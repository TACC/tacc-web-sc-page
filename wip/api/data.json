      "description": "Power and energy are critical constraints for exascale supercomputing. Optimizing for application performance under such constraints is becoming challenging due to the dynamic phase behavior of scientific codes, increasing variation in processor power efficiency resulting from manufacturing, and due to complexities arising from upcoming heterogeneous architectures. <br><br>In order to address some of these challenges, this half-day hands-on tutorial will discuss GEOPM (Global Extensible Open Power Manager) as an emerging, cross-community, cross-platform, open source (BSD 3-clause), job-level power management framework that is capable of providing feedback to job schedulers and resource managers in order to drive system power efficiency improvements. This framework is part of OpenHPC and a key pillar of the software stack in the upcoming first exascale system at Argonne National Laboratory in the US. It optimizes for time-to-solution by leveraging techniques from learning and control systems. GEOPM leverages hardware monitoring and control knobs provided by modern processors. <br><br>In this hands-on tutorial, we will discuss the state-of-the-art power management techniques and show the areas where GEOPM can provide benefit over and above those techniques. A high-level overview of the GEOPM architecture, a walkthrough of the GEOPM plugin infrastructure, and example exercises for hands-on practice will be demoed."

      "description": "The recent advances in Deep Learning (DL) has led to many exciting challenges and opportunities for Computer Science and AI researchers alike. Modern DL frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, Cognitive Toolkit, Caffe2, and several others have emerged that offer ease of use and flexibility to train, and deploy various types of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). <br><br>In this tutorial, we will provide an overview of interesting trends in DNN design and how cutting-edge hardware architectures are playing a key role in moving the field forward. We will also present an overview of different DNN architectures and DL frameworks. Most DL frameworks started with a single-node/single-GPU design. However, approaches to parallelize the process of DNN training are also being actively explored. The DL community has moved along different distributed training designs that exploit communication runtimes like gRPC, MPI, and NCCL. We will highlight new challenges and opportunities for communication runtimes to efficiently support distributed DNN training. We also highlight some of our co-design efforts to utilize CUDA-aware MPI for large-scale DNN training on modern GPU clusters. Finally, we include hands-on exercises to enable the attendees to gain first-hand experience of running distributed DNN training experiments on a modern GPU cluster."

      "description": "While scientific software is widely used in several science and engineering disciplines, developing accurate and reliable scientific software is notoriously difficult. One of the most serious difficulties comes from dealing with floating-point arithmetic to perform numerical computations. Round-off errors occur and accumulate at all levels of computation, and compiler optimizations and low precision arithmetic can significantly affect the final computational results. With accelerators dominating high-performance computing systems, computational scientists are faced with even bigger challenges, given that ensuring numerical reproducibility in these systems pose a very difficult problem. <br><br>This tutorial will demonstrate tools that are available today to analyze floating-point scientific software. We focus on tools that allow programmers to get insight about how different aspects of floating-point arithmetic affects their code and how to fix potential bugs. Some of the floating-point analysis areas that we cover in the tutorial are compiler optimizations, floating-point exceptions on GPUs, precision tuning, sensitivity to rounding errors, non-determinism, and data races."

      "description": "A key trend facing extreme-scale computational science is the widening gap between computational and I/O rates.  The challenge is how to best gain insight from simulation data when it is increasingly impractical to save it to persistent storage for subsequent visualization and analysis.  One approach to this challenge is the idea of in situ processing, where one performs visualization and analysis processing while data is still resident in memory.  The HPC visualization community provides several production tools for in situ processing and is actively researching infrastructures and approaches to help with in situ use cases on current and future HPC platforms.<br><br>This tutorial blends lectures and hands-on examples to introduce attendees to in situ processing concepts and provide practical experience using state-of-the-art and -practice in situ tools, including:  SENSEI, ParaView Catalyst, VisIt Libsim, ADIOS, and ALPINE Ascent.  Attendees will learn how to use the SENSEI and Ascent in situ interfaces to couple simulation codes to multiple endpoints.  This tutorial is ideal for those who would like to learn how to analyze, visualize, or process data on HPC platforms while it is still resident in memory."

      "description": "Quantum computing offers the potential to revolutionize high-performance computing by providing a means to solve certain computational problems asymptotically faster than any classical computer.  Relatively recently, quantum computing has advanced from merely a theoretical possibility to engineered reality, including commercial entities offering early prototype quantum processors, both special-purpose quantum annealers and general-purpose gate-model processors. The media has been showcasing each new development and implicitly conveying the message that quantum-computing ubiquity is nigh. Here, we will respond to this hype and provide an overview of the exciting but still early state of the field.<br><br>In this tutorial, we introduce participants to the computational model that gives quantum computing its immense computational power. We examine the thought processes that programmers need to map problems onto the two dominant quantum-computing architectures. And we discuss the current hardware and algorithmic challenges that must be overcome before quantum computing becomes a component of the HPC developer\u2019s repertoire."

      "description": "With the increasing prevalence of multi-core processors, shared-memory programming models are essential. OpenMP is a popular, portable, widely supported, and easy-to-use shared-memory model. Since version 3.0 released in 2008, OpenMP offers tasking to support the creation of composable parallel software blocks and the parallelization of irregular algorithms. Developers usually find OpenMP easy to learn. However, mastering the tasking concept of OpenMP requires a change in the way developers reason about the structure of their code and how to expose the parallelism of it. Our tutorial addresses this critical aspect by examining the tasking concept in detail and presenting patterns as solutions to many common problems.<br><br>We assume attendees understand basic parallelization concepts and know the fundamentals of OpenMP. We present the OpenMP tasking language features in detail and focus on performance aspects, such as introducing cut-off mechanisms, exploiting task dependencies, and preserving locality. All aspects are accompanied by extensive case studies.  We will include hands-on sessions. Throughout all topics, we present the features of OpenMP 4.5 and the additions that appeared in OpenMP 5.0, released during SC18."

      "description": "The advent of multi- and manycore chips has led to a further opening of the gap between peak and application performance for many scientific codes. This trend is accelerating as we move from petascale to exascale. Paradoxically, bad node-level performance helps to \"efficiently\" scale to massive parallelism, but at the price of increased overall time to solution. If the user cares about time to solution on any scale, optimal performance on the node level is often the key factor. We convey the architectural features of current processor chips, multiprocessor nodes, and accelerators, as far as they are relevant for the practitioner. Peculiarities like SIMD vectorization, shared vs. separate caches, bandwidth bottlenecks, and ccNUMA characteristics are introduced, and the influence of system topology and affinity on the performance of typical parallel programming constructs is demonstrated. Performance engineering and performance patterns are suggested as powerful tools that help the user understand the bottlenecks at hand and to assess the impact of possible code optimizations. A cornerstone of these concepts is the roofline model, which is described in detail, including useful case studies, limits of its applicability, and possible refinements."

      "description": "OpenMP is the de facto standard for writing parallel applications for shared memory computers.  Born 20 years ago in 1997, it runs on just about every shared memory platform in the market.  It\u2019s also very complicated. We created OpenMP to be the \u201ceasy API\u201d for application programmers.  With a specification running to over 300 pages, OpenMP has grown into an intimidating API viewed by many as for \u201cexperts only\u201d.<br><br>Most OpenMP programmers, however, use around 20 items from OpenMP.  We call this subset the \u201cOpenMP Common Core\u201d.   By focusing on the common core, we make OpenMP what it was always meant to be; an easy API for parallel application programmers.  <br><br>In this hands-on tutorial, we explore the OpenMP Common Core.  We utilize active learning through a carefully selected set of exercises, so students master the common core and learn to apply it to their own problems. The exercises use a simple subset of C:  Fortran programmers will have no problem keeping up.  <br><br>Students will use their own laptops to access remote systems that support OpenMP (a remote SMP server). Alternatively, students can load an OpenMP compiler onto their laptops before the tutorial.  Information about OpenMP compilers is available at www.openmp.org."

This tutorial sheds light on the state-of-the-art in parallel I/O and provides the knowledge necessary for attendees to best leverage I/O resources available to them. We cover the entire I/O software stack including storage and parallel file systems at the lowest layer, the role of burst buffers (NVRAM), intermediate layers (such as MPI-IO), and high-level I/O libraries (such as HDF5). We emphasize ways to use these interfaces that result in high performance and tools for generating insight into these stacks. Benchmarks on real systems are used throughout to show real-world results.<br><br>In the first third of the tutorial we cover the fundamentals of parallel I/O.  We discuss storage technologies, both present and near-future.   Our parallel file systems material covers general concepts and gives examples from Lustre, GPFS, PanFS, HDFS, Ceph, and Cloud Storage.  Our second third takes a more application-oriented focus. We examine the upper library layers of the I/O stack, covering MPI-IO,   Parallel netCDF, and HDF5. We discuss interface features, show code examples, and describe how application calls translate into PFS operations.  Finally we discuss tools for capturing and understanding I/O behavior."

      "description": "High performance computing increasingly involves the development and deployment of network and cloud services to access resources for computation, communication, data, instruments, and analytics. Unique to the HPC field is the large amount of software that we develop to drive these services. These services must assure data integrity and availability, while providing access to a global scientific and engineering community. <br><br>Securing your network is not enough. Every service that you deploy is a window into your data center from the outside world, and a window that could be exploited by an attacker.  This tutorial is relevant to anyone wanting to learn about minimizing security flaws in the software they develop or manage.  You will learn skills critical for software developers and analysts concerned with security. <br><br>Software assurance tools \u2013 tools that scan the source or binary code of a program to find weaknesses \u2013 are the first line of defense in assessing the security of a software project. These tools can catch flaws in a program that affect both the correctness and safety of the code. This tutorial is also relevant to anyone wanting to learn how to use these automated assessment tools to minimize security flaws."

      "description": "At this point, GPUs are an integral part of high-performance computing, and GPU acceleration seems to be the only viable path for reaching exascale. Under such circumstances, it is critical for computational scientists to invest in GPU programming skills if they want to be competitive in their field. In this tutorial, we attempt to cover the full spectrum of GPU kernel\u2013development techniques. We start by introducing the basics of GPU programming with CUDA and HIP and then shift the focus to solutions aimed at portability: OpenMP, OpenACC, Kokkos, and KokkosKernels. We also include an extensive presentation of automated performance tuning methodologies. Our objective is twofold: (1) prevent younger researchers from reinventing the wheel when it comes to producing GPU-accelerated numerical software and (2) steer the attendees away from one-off solutions and motivate them to invest their efforts in more portable and more sustainable approaches."

      "description": "Reproducibility is an important concern in all areas of computation. As such, computational reproducibility is receiving increasing interest from a variety of parties who are concerned with different aspects of computational reproducibility. Computational reproducibility encompasses several concerns including the sharing of code and data, as well as reproducible numerical results which may depend on operating system, tools, levels of parallelism, and numerical effects. In addition, the publication of reproducible computational results motivates a host of computational reproducibility concerns that arise from the fundamental notion of reproducibility of scientific results that has normally been restricted to experimental science.<br><br>The workshop addresses issues in reproducibility that arise when computing at exascale. It will include issues of numerical reproducibility as well as approaches and best practices to sharing and running code and the reproducible dissemination of computational results. The workshop is meant to address the scope of the problems of computational reproducibility in HPC in general, and those anticipated as we scale up to exascale machines in the next decade. The participants of this workshop will include government, academic, and industry stakeholders; the goals of this workshop are to understand the current state of the problems that arise, what work is being done to deal with this issues, and what the community thinks the possible approaches to these problem are."

      "description": "Reproducibility is an important concern in all areas of computation. As such, computational reproducibility is receiving increasing interest from a variety of parties who are concerned with different aspects of computational reproducibility. Computational reproducibility encompasses several concerns including the sharing of code and data, as well as reproducible numerical results which may depend on operating system, tools, levels of parallelism, and numerical effects. In addition, the publication of reproducible computational results motivates a host of computational reproducibility concerns that arise from the fundamental notion of reproducibility of scientific results that has normally been restricted to experimental science.<br><br>The workshop addresses issues in reproducibility that arise when computing at exascale. It will include issues of numerical reproducibility as well as approaches and best practices to sharing and running code and the reproducible dissemination of computational results. The workshop is meant to address the scope of the problems of computational reproducibility in HPC in general, and those anticipated as we scale up to exascale machines in the next decade. The participants of this workshop will include government, academic, and industry stakeholders; the goals of this workshop are to understand the current state of the problems that arise, what work is being done to deal with this issues, and what the community thinks the possible approaches to these problem are.<br><br><a href=\"http://www.cs.fsu.edu/~cre/cre-2019/index.html\" target=\"_blank\"> http://www.cs.fsu.edu/~cre/cre-2019/index.html</a>"

      "description": "Simulations of biological macromolecules are important in understanding the physical basis of complex processes such as protein folding. However, even with increasing computational capacity and specialized architectures, the ability to simulate protein folding at atomistic scales still remains challenging. This stems from the dual aspects of high dimensionality of protein conformational landscapes, and the inability of atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to sufficiently sample these landscapes to observe folding events. Machine learning/deep learning (ML/DL) techniques, when combined with atomistic MD  simulations offer the opportunity to potentially overcome these limitations by: (1) effectively reducing the dimensionality of MD simulations to automatically build latent representations that correspond to biophysically relevant reaction coordinates (RCs), and (2) driving MD simulations to automatically sample potentially novel conformational states based on these RCs. We examine how coupling DL approaches with MD simulations can lead to effective approaches to fold small proteins on supercomputers. In particular, we study the computational costs and effectiveness of scaling DL-coupled MD workflows implemented using RADICAL-Cybertools in folding two prototypical systems, namely Fs-peptide and the fast-folding variant of the villin head piece protein. We demonstrate that a DL-coupled MD workflow is able to effectively learn latent representations and drive adaptive simulations. Compared to traditional MD-based approaches, our approach achieves an effective performance gain in sampling the folded states by at least 2.3x. Together, our study provides quantitative basis to understand how coupling DL approaches to MD simulations, can lead to effective performance gains and reduced times to solution on supercomputing resources."

      "description": "Facial recognition is a tractable problem today because of the prevalence of Deep Learning implementations. Approaches for creating structured datasets from unstructured web data are more easily accessible as are GPUs that deep learning frameworks can use to learn from this data. In DARPA\u2019s MEMEX effort, which sought to create better search capabilities for law enforcement to scan the deep and dark web, we are interested in leveraging the Tensorflow framework to reproduce a seminal Deep Learning facial recognition model called VGG- Face. On MEMEX we desired to build the VGG-Face model and to train feature extraction for use in prioritization of leads for possible law enforcement follow-up. We describe our efforts to recreate the VGG-Face dataset, along with our efforts to create the Deep Learning network implementation for it using Tensorflow. Though other implementations of VGG-Face on Tensorflow exist, none of them fully reproduce as much of the dataset as we do today (\u223c 48% of the data still exists), nor have detailed documentation and steps for reproducing each step in the workflow. We contribute those instructions and leverage Texas Advanced Computing Center\u2019s Maverick2 supercomputer to perform the work. We report experimental results on building the dataset, and training the network to achieve a 77.99% validation accuracy on the 2, 622 celebrity use case from VGG-Face. This paper can be a useful recipe in building new Tensorflow facial recognition."

Real-time data analysis can enable both detection of, and recovery from, errors, and optimization of data acquisition. However, modern scientific instruments, such as detectors at synchrotron light sources, can generate data at GBs/sec rates. Data processing methods such as the widely used computational tomography usually require considerable computational resources, and yield poor quality reconstructions in the early stages of data acquisition when available views are sparse. <br><br>We describe here how a deep convolutional neural network can be integrated into the real-time streaming tomography pipeline to enable better-quality images in the early stages of data acquisition. Compared with conventional streaming tomography processing, our method can significantly improve tomography image quality, deliver comparable images using only 32% of the data needed for conventional streaming processing, and save 68% experiment time for data acquisition."

The inherently long-running, highly concurrent, and random file accesses can easily saturate traditional shared file systems and negatively impact other users. We investigate here a solution to these problems based on leveraging local storage and the interconnect to serve training datasets at scale. We present FanStore, a user-level transient object store that provides low-latency and scalable POSIX-compliant file access by integrating the function interception technique and various metadata/data placement strategies. On a single node, FanStore provides performance similar to that of the XFS journaling file system. On many nodes, our experiments with real applications show that FanStore achieves over 90% scaling efficiency."

The  geographic  extent,  spatial  heterogeneity,  and multiple  correlation  length  scales  of  the  Hanford  Site  require training a computationally intensive GAN model to thousands of dimensions. We develop a highly optimized implementation that scales to 27,500 NVIDIA Volta GPUs. We develop a hierarchical scheme based on a multi-player game-theoretic approach for exploiting domain parallelism, map discriminators and generators to  multiple  GPUs,  and  employ  efficient  communication  schemes to ensure training stability and convergence. Our implementation scales to 4584 nodes on the Summit supercomputer with a 93.1%scaling  efficiency,  achieving  peak  and  sustained  half-precision . rates of 1228  PF/s  and 1207  PF/s."

      "description": "In this work we present our results designing a deep neural network (DNN) to act as a surrogate model for costly HPC simulations. In order to determine a ground vehicle's gap crossing ability in extreme weather scenarios, several HPC simulations are currently used. Hydrologic models are first run to determine the environmental conditions over an area of interest.  Once these conditions are known they are given, along with the terrain data, to a vehicle simulation which determines if a particular vehicle can cross a stream at a given point. Every point of interest must be evaluated independently, which quickly becomes infeasible for a large numbers of crossing points. In order to accelerate this phase of the process, we have created a DNN that acts as a surrogate model for the vehicle simulator. Despite several challenges converting irregular data into a form that can be used with a DNN, and incorporating scalars into the models, we were able to produce DNN models that predicted the gap crossing ability of all vehicle types with over 95% accuracy."

      "description": "Mapping all the neurons in the brain requires automatic reconstruction of entire cells from volume electron microscopy data. The flood-filling network (FFN) architecture has demonstrated leading performance for segmenting structures from this data. However, the training of the network is computationally expensive. In order to reduce the training time, we implemented synchronous and data-parallel distributed training using the Horovod library, which is different from the asynchronous training scheme used in the published FFN code. We demonstrated that our distributed training scaled well up to 2048 Intel Knights Landing (KNL) nodes on the Theta supercomputer. Our trained models achieved similar level of inference performance, but took less training time compared to previous methods. Our study on the effects of different batch sizes on FFN training suggests ways to further improve training efficiency. Our findings on optimal learning rate and batch sizes agree with previous works."

      "description": "Deep-learner  hyper-parameters,  such  as kernel sizes, batch sizes, and learning rates, can significantly influence the quality of trained models. The state of the art for finding optimal hyper-parameters generally uses a brute force, grid search approach, random search,  or  Bayesian-based  optimization  among  other techniques.  We  applied  an  evolutionary  algorithm  to optimize kernel sizes for a convolutional neural network used to detect settlements in satellite imagery. Usually convolutional layer kernel sizes are small \u2013 typically one, three, or five \u2013 but we found that the system converged at, or near, kernel sizes of nine for the last convolutional layer,  and  that  this  occurred  for  multiple  runs  using two different datasets. Moreover, the larger kernel sizes had fewer false positives than the 3x3 kernel sizes found as optimal via a brute force uniform grid search. This suggests that this large kernel size may be leveraging patterns  found  in  larger  areal  features  in  the  source imagery, and that this may be generalized as possible guidance for similar remote sensing deep-learning tasks."

      "description": "Frontera is the largest NSF-funded cluster in the US and comprises of 8,008 nodes equipped with the latest Intel Xeon processors (Cascade-Lake). In this paper, we explore the potential of Frontera for training state-of-the-art Deep Learning (DL) models at scale. Most DL studies present performance data from large-scale GPU clusters that are equipped with NVIDIA GPUs. However, our earlier performance characterization studies have helped us achieve comparable performance with CPU-only clusters as well. Based on this, we configure three important DL frameworks; 1) TensorFlow, 2) PyTorch, and 3) MXNet, using Horovod and two Message Passing Interface (MPI) libraries on Frontera: 1) MVAPICH2 and 2) Intel MPI. We provide a systematic performance comparison for TensorFlow using MVAPICH2 and Intel MPI on 2,048 Frontera nodes. Using a four process per-node configuration, we observe near-linear scaling for ResNet-50 training for TensorFlow up to 8,192 MPI processes (on 2,048 nodes) offering a sustained performance of 250,000 images/second. In addition, we provide insights into process per node and batch size configurations for TensorFlow as well as for PyTorch and MXNet. Based on single-node performance behavior, we scale all three DL frameworks up to 1,024 processes (256 nodes) for various models like ResNet-50/101/152 and Inception-v3/v4."

We offer recommendations for deploying and scaling DL frameworks on the Summit supercomputer, currently atop the Top500 list, at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory Leadership Computing Facility (OLCF). We discuss DL software deployment in the form of containers, and compare performance of native-built frameworks and containerized deployment. Software containers show no noticeable negative performance impact and exhibit faster Python loading times and promise easier maintenance. To explore strategies for scaling up DL model training campaigns, we assess DL compute kernel performance, discuss and recommend I/O data formats and staging, and identify communication needs for scalable message exchange for DL runs at scale. We recommend that users take a step-wise tuning approach beginning with algorithmic kernel choice, node I/O configuration, and communications tuning as best-practice.   We present baseline examples of scaling efficiency 87% for a DL run of ResNet50 running on 1024 nodes (6144 V100 GPUs)."

Simultaneously, advances in computational capabilities, with exceptional growth in deep learning, are expected to continue to reach unprecedented scales. Such opportunities to impact cancer computationally are underscored in the 2016 US Twenty-first Century Cures Act and international efforts such as the ITCC-P4 focusing on development treatments for pediatric cancer. The workshop focuses on bringing together interested individuals ranging from clinicians, mathematicians, data scientists, computational scientists, engineers, developers, leaders and others with an interest in advancing the use of computation at all levels to better understand, diagnose, treat and prevent cancer. As an interdisciplinary workshop, the cross-disciplinary sharing of insight and challenges fosters collaborations and future innovations to accelerate the progress in computationally and data driven cancer research and clinical applications. A special emphasis for the 2019 workshop is the role of computing in drug discovery for cancer, with a special emphasis on the role of AI, machine learning, and deep learning approaches applied to drug discovery and precision medicine."

      "description": "We develop a novel deep learning workflow to effectively combine expensive but accurate molecular dynamics (MD) based BFE calculations with fast machine learning models to predict the affinity of compounds. In this approach, candidates are sampled from a large billion-compound synthetically accessible space (such as Enamine REAL) or de novo molecule generator. Sampling is designed to rapidly and parsimoniously train an inexpensive surrogate model from BFE calculations, creating a tool capable of accurately scoring vast libraries of molecules.  This will be achieved by using an active learning approach to guide the choice of BFE calculations performed. Development of the workflow will be driven by applications and datasets provided by partners in both the pharmaceutical and healthcare sectors. Common to both is the need to react to the evolution of resistance to selective pharmaceutical compounds which undermines treatment of infections (both bacterial and viral) and human cancers. The dramatic reduction in the cost of genome sequencing has enabled genes to be identified in which variation potentially confers resistance, thereby creating the possibility of screening individual samples of infections or tumors to ascertain which drugs will be most effective. Learning from progress made in the INSPIRE project (which focused on tyrosine kinase resistance), we develop a platform combining molecular modeling and machine learning approaches to support representative workflow which brings together physical modeling and machine learning to identify novel potent and selective compounds."

      "description": "Background:  Lung cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world. It is a leading cause of cancer death in men and women in the United States. Computational approaches such as deep learning could help accurate and efficient analysis of biomarkers, both histopathology and radiology, to assist cancer drug discovery and development.  PD-L1 expression in the tumor micro-environment is one of the efficacy predictors of cancer treatment using immune checkpoint inhibitors. Tumor proportion score (the ratio of PD-L1 expressed area within the total tumor area) is often used as a measure to distinguish low and high PD-L1 expression. However, due to difficulty in quantitative measurement of microscopic images, the proportion score is prone to be evaluated subjectively. A more objective way by using computational techniques which can quantify PL-L1 expression only in the tumor cells is highly desirable.  In addition, nodules detected on a chest radiograph (CR) is a good clinical marker for detection and progression of the disease. Interpretation of CR has problems of overlooking nodules and the reported error rates for missed lung cancer on CR are 20%-50%. Deep learning techniques can overcome the accuracy challenges of conventional interpretation and can improve the quality of the clinical biomarker.<br><br>Objective:  One of our objectives is to create an image analysis system to automatically recognize the \u201ctotal tumor area\u201d and \u201ctumor area with PD-L1 expression\u201d in order to derive a quantitatively measured \u201ctumor proportion score\u201d. The second objective is to develop an algorithm with deep learning techniques for detecting lung cancer on CR and assess its performance.<br><br>Materials and Methods:  For the PD-L1 expression study, whole slide images (WSI) of lung cancer pathology were used. Small patches were randomly selected from WSI to train our segmentation model. Deep convolutional neural networks were built and the segmentation model was trained using the extracted and annotated patches. Training has been done with 34 patches of 1000 x 1000 pixel images.  The algorithm for lung nodule detection was developed by segmentation method with encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder used Inception-ResNet-v2 model as the backbone algorithm to extract features. The decoder was designed to compute up convolution to detect lung nodule or mass with segmentation. Training and test data were obtained from University of Osaka Medical School.<br><br>Results and Discussions:  We have demonstrated that application of deep learning to microscopic images has potential in the following tasks: Distinguishing cancerous regions from other tissue regions, Segmentation of regions with PD-L1 expression, Quantitative evaluation of tumor proportion score.  An accurate and fast quantitative evaluation of PD-LI expression on tumor cells (not confounded by PL-L1 expression in non-cancer area) would provide a more accurate indication of drug efficacy in high content screening.  The algorithm for detection of nodules in CR achieved high performance. The sensitivity, Positive Predictive Value (PPV), and False Positive per Image (FPI) were determined to be 73.0%, 85.3%, and 0.13, respectively. This lung nodule detection algorithm could provide a reliable radiology biomarker in lung cancer clinical trials."

      "description": "De Novo design of therapeutic agents is currently a slow, expensive process generally relying on a large high throughput screen and several follow up cycles of iterative design to enhance the potency, eliminate safety liabilities, and enable favorable pharmacokinetic behavior. Computer aided drug discovery (CADD) has significantly aided this though structure and ligand-based design techniques, however current application often focuses on optimizing a single molecular property at a time, leading to long design cycle times. Recent advances in generative models for chemistry, including variational autoencoders (VAEs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs) have enabled a continuous representation of chemical space, allowing for application of numerical optimization techniques to this multi-factorial problem. As a proof of concept exercise, optimization of generative network across a diverse range of pharmacological properties was performed utilizing a high-performance scalable framework. Specifically, the algorithm was challenged to design a potent inhibitor of Aurora Kinase B, an enzyme involved with cell division and drug target in at least 12 ongoing and completed oncology trials. For a more realistic lead optimization challenge, the algorithm was also tasked with selectivity against the related Aurora Kinase A while simultaneously maintaining favorable secondary pharmacology properties (i.e. safety and pharmacokinetics). Running on a multi-node cluster, the framework was able to generate, evaluate and rank 3 million compounds, including >200 de novo molecules with predicted properties meeting the acceptability criteria. Experimental validation was performed for approximately 100 of the de novo molecules through chemical synthesis and in vitro testing."

      "description": "Mutations of the KRAS gene are a prevalent driver in nearly 30% of all human cancers. It is hypothesized that the KRAS dimerization may facilitate RAF clustering, which is known to be required for RAF activation [1]. A recent study [2] has demonstrated the requirement of KRAS dimerization to sustain the oncogenic function of mutant KRAS and reveals that the disruption of dimerization could be a potential therapeutic strategy that may be effective in KRAS mutant cancers. Consequently, it is crucial to identify the stable states of KRAS dimers. Identifying conformational states in KRAS monomers can be achieved using hand engineered features, such as tilt and rotation angles [3]. However, a similar approach is challenging in KRAS dimers because the complexity of the structure makes it a nontrivial task to identify the right set of angles for adequate feature representation.<br><br>We present our ongoing efforts on the state identification in KRAS dimers and associated lipids using ML-based models. In particular, with the advent of deep learning based approaches, it has become possible to use the raw coordinates of molecules to identify their states and the corresponding stability [4,5]. Our initial experiments support the hypothesis that state identification can be reduced to an unsupervised clustering problem in a latent space, which represents the underlying manifold governing the data distribution. We employ variational autoencoders using deep neural networks [6] to encode the molecular coordinates of the KRAS dimer and the interacting lipid density fields into a meaningful latent space. <br><br>Our training data comes from a massive simulation campaign using our MuMMI framework [7] that was run on up to 4000 nodes of the Sierra supercomputer at LLNL. Using data from 120,000 coarse-grained MD simulations each over 1 microsecond long, we train the neural network using NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPUs to reduce the spatial coordinates into a low-dimensional latent space. We perform spectral clustering in the latent space to determine, in an unsupervised manner, the number of distinct clusters\u2014each corresponding to a distinct state of the RAS dimer. Identified distinct clusters are then analyzed further for their geometrical information and lifetime to understand their stability. Moreover, this information is in the context of different lipid compositions, so the lipid-dependence of the KRAS dimerization can also be tested.<br><br>We believe that meaningful state identification in KRAS dimers and associated lipids using ML-based unsupervised methods can provide key insights for experiments facilitating therapeutic strategies.

      "description": "Modeling interactions with biological targets is a necessary step to begin reasoning about the therapeutic potential of a novel molecule in the drug discovery process. Molecular docking aids drug discovery researchers by searching over potential binding \u2018poses\u2019 of a drug molecule, ranking these poses according a scoring function, and using this information to identify the binding mode of a protein-small molecule complex, allowing for the quantification of the strength of the molecules binding interaction with their intended protein targets. While these simulations are able to scale on large computing clusters, the results that are produced are not generally accurate. Often the \u2018best\u2019 pose as identified by the docking algorithm is not actually the \u2018correct\u2019 pose. The score of the \u2018best\u2019 pose is also not highly correlated with an experimental binding affinity when it is known. The issues that arise with scoring functions in many molecular docking pipelines make this step of in silico prediction of binding strength even more difficult. A productive step forward would suggest a scoring function that is able to address these issues. Deep learning methods such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNNs) have shown promise in providing researchers frameworks from which it is possible to model binding affinity with reasonable predictivity on experimental datasets.  As part of an ongoing collaboration effort between Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and the American Heart Association towards developing a human-protein drug atlas, we are investigating the effectiveness of convolutional neural networks and spatial graph methods for improving the accuracy and throughput of molecular docking pipelines to help address scaling challenges in the development of this resource. <br><br>This work was performed under the auspices of the U.S. Department of Energy by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory under Contract DE-AC52-07NA27344."

Combining experimental data from several studies is an attractive approach, but presents two problems: batch effects and limited data for individual drugs and cell lines. Batch effects are caused by systematic procedural differences among studies, which causes systematic experimental outcome differences. Directly using these experimental results as features for machine learning commonly causes problems when training on one study and testing on another. This severely limits a model\u2019s ability to perform well on new experiments. Even after combining studies, predicting outcomes on new patient tumors remains an open challenge.<br><br>We propose a semi-supervised, autoencoder-based, machine learning procedure, which learns a smaller set of gene expression features that are robust to batch effects using background information on a cell line or tissue\u2019s tumor type. We implemented this reduced feature representation and show that the new feature space clusters strongly according to tumor type. This experiment is carried out across multiple studies: CCLE, CTRP, gCSI, GDSC, NCI60, and patient derived tumors. We hypothesize that using a batch effect resistant feature set across studies will improve prediction performance.<br><br>Genome Data Commons (GDC) gene expression profiles for publicly available human tissues and cell lines from NCI60 and CCLE were processed using the semi-supervised learning procedure. Our autoencoder repurposes the \u2018center loss\u2019 (CL) cost function of Wen et. al. to learn a more generalized set of features using the cell line or tissue\u2019s tumor type. Classification is performed by branching network the \u2018pinch\u2019 layer of the autoencoder. The \u2018pinch\u2019 layer now gets fed into a classification layer as well as the decoder portion of the autoencoder.<br><br>The new cost function balances the reconstruction performance, with the classification and \u2018center loss\u2019 performance. Reconstruction performance ensures that the \u2018pinch\u2019 layer retains information about original gene expression while classification performance shapes the space so tumors of the same type of close together regardless of the source study. Using the \u2018pinch\u2019 layer as new features reduces the number of features from 17,000 genes to approximately 1000 features or as few as 20 features.  The performance of this method is compared with traditional batch correction methods (e.g. ComBat). Before applying these methods, individual samples clustered more strongly along study, a property that is not useful in many machine learning applications. We compare the new features from our \u2018center loss\u2019 autoencoder and ComBat using Silhouette score, the Calinski \u2013 Harabasz index, and the Davies \u2013 Bouldin index. All metrics show that using the prosed \u2018center loss\u2019 autoencoder features provide a latent space with better clusters than applying ComBat."

      "description": "Recent advances in high-performance computing systems for artificial intelligence enable large-scale training of information extraction models from free-form natural language texts. The development of these models is essential to the cancer surveillance research and automation. In this study, we propose an approach to accelerate training of machine learning models by introducing task parallelism. For the information extraction from cancer pathology reports, we implement task parallelism by splitting the task of identifying multiple cancer topography and morphology into several sub-problems. This allows for the hyperparameters for each sub-problem to be optimized in parallel. Further, we introduce the model parameter inheritance to improve the convergence rate of the hyperparameter optimization runs themselves. We evaluate the feasibility of the proposed method on the Summit supercomputer and demonstrate that it improves time-to-solution by a factor of 10, when compared to the traditional model-based optimization algorithm, while maintaining the same level of clinical task performance scores."

      "description": "Cancer is a complex multiscale dynamical systems problem with interactions between the tumor and host at the molecular, cellular, tissue, and organism levels. Moreover, treatment occurs within a larger dynamical system that couples clinical care teams, hospital systems, industry, and government policies. For individuals, effective patient-tailored therapeutic guidance and planning will require bridging spatiotemporal scales with modeling from atomistic to organismal levels. At the societal level, improving the patient population\u2019s overall health and quality of life requires understanding how actions by patients, clinicians, researchers, and government agencies impact one another.<br><br>Predictive oncology aims to predict and steer each patient\u2019s future disease dynamics, but it cannot be fully realized by any single technology, laboratory, or discipline. It will require a coordinated multidisciplinary, multi-institutional effort with access to sufficient data and computational resources. The past decade has seen tremendous advances in data-rich medical measurements; biological theories of cancer progression, therapeutic response and resistance; artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning techniques; next-generation high-performance computing; multiscale modeling and simulation; and secure high-speed data infrastructures. The time is ripe to leverage these advances to create digital twins for predictive cancer care: patient-tailored models that can evaluate thousands of potential therapeutic plans, help clinicians understand and choose the plan that best meets the patient\u2019s objectives, benchmark clinical performance, and continuously integrate new data and knowledge to refine treatment plans. This talk will discuss a community-driven initiative to design HPC-enabled digital twins for predictive cancer care, available technologies, barriers that must be overcome, and ongoing opportunities to help translate digital twins to clinical practice.<br><br>In 2016, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the Department of Energy (DOE) partnered to create Joint Design of Advanced Computing Solutions for Cancer (JDACS4C): a collaboration of multidisciplinary experts in the biological, computational, data, and physical sciences at the NCI, the Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, and four DOE national laboratories. JDACS4C aims to develop, demonstrate, and disseminate advanced computational capabilities that help answer driving scientific questions across molecular, cellular and population scales. These efforts frame forward-looking approaches for integrating and analyzing large, heterogeneous data collections with advanced computational modeling that will accelerate predictive oncology.<br><br>In March 2019, the agencies built on JDACS4C\u2019s team science approach to launch the Envisioning Computational Innovations for Cancer Challenges (ECICC) community. A series of ECICC events identified the digital twin initiative as a key opportunity to push the limits of computational approaches to cancer care, compel the development of innovative computational technologies, and bring about new paradigms for care.<br> <br>Digital twins have great potential to help patients reach their treatment goals. Aggregated data from populations of digital twins could help improve national strategies for cancer screening, prevention, research investment, and structuring healthcare systems. The ECICC community has initiated work to create this national resource, but it can only succeed with expanded contributions by the experimental, computational, and clinical communities. After outlining next steps, we will present opportunities to contribute to and drive the effort."

      "description": "Cancer pathology reports comprise a rich source of data for surveilling cancer incidents and tracking cancer trends across the United States. Cancer registries manually extract key pieces of information from these reports including tumor site, histology, laterality, behavior, grade, and metastatic status. Automating this task is critical for an efficient and scalable processing pipeline of these reports. Deep neural networks have recently been shown to perform well on this information extraction task by casting it as a document classification problem. However, neural networks are prone to overfitting in low-sample regimes and are unable to quantify their own uncertainty. Deep kernel learning (DKL) has recently emerged as a simple and scalable paradigm to hybridize deep neural networks and Bayesian models, which may help to remedy some of these shortcomings of neural networks. A DKL model is obtained by feeding a neural network feature extractor into a Gaussian process (GP) classifier and training the resulting model with gradient descent in a variational inference framework. In this project, we build a DKL model with a shallow-wide convolutional neural network (CNN) feature extractor and use it to extract primary tumor site information from a dataset of de-identified cancer pathology reports. As far as we are aware, this marks the first application of DKL to document classification. Our DKL model outperforms the state-of-the-art CNN on this dataset. We also show that pretraining a CNN with the weights of a DKL model boosts performance, suggesting that DKL is beneficial not just because of GP inference at test time but also because DKL is able to extract better feature representations from the pathology reports through Bayesian training. We conclude that DKL has the potential to boost the performance of neural networks for information extraction on pathology reports while requiring little modification of the original network architecture, and that DKL can offer a path forward to develop scalable deep Bayesian models for such tasks."

      "description": "The temporal and spatial resolution in the microscopy of tissues has increased significantly within the last years, yielding new insights into the dynamics of tissue development and the role of the single-cell within it. A thorough theoretical description of the connection of single-cell processes to macroscopic tissue reorganizations is still lacking. Especially in tumor development, single cells play a crucial role in advance of tumor properties. We developed a simulation framework that can model tissue development up to the centimeter scale with micrometer resolution of single cells. Through a full parallelization, it enables the efficient use of high-performance computing systems, therefore enabling detailed simulations on a large scale. We developed a generalized tumor model that respects adhesion driven cell migration, cell-to-cell signaling, and mutation-driven tumor heterogeneity. We scan the response of the tumor development depending on division inhibiting substances such as cytostatic agents. Furthermore, we are investigating the interaction with radiation therapy to find a suitable therapy plan."

      "description": "High-level synthesis (HLS) tools have brought FPGA development into the mainstream, by allowing programmers to design architectures using familiar languages such as C, C++, and OpenCL. While the move to these languages has brought significant benefits, many aspects of traditional software engineering are still unsupported, or not exploited by developers in practice. Furthermore, designing reconfigurable architectures requires support for hardware constructs and workflows that are not covered by CPU-oriented tools and languages. To address this gap, we have developed hlslib, a collection of software tools, plug-in hardware modules, and code samples, designed to enhance the productivity of HLS developers. The goal of hlslib is two-fold: first, create a community-driven arena of bleeding edge development, which can move quicker, and provides more powerful abstractions than what is provided by vendors; and second, collect a wide range of example codes, both minimal proofs of concept, and larger, real-world applications, that can be reused directly or inspire other work. hlslib is offered as an open source library, containing CMake files, C++ headers, convenience scripts, and examples codes, and is receptive to any contribution that can benefit HLS developers, through general functionality or examples."

      "description": "The goal of this work is to adapt 4 CFD kernels to the Xilinx ALVEO U250 FPGA, including first-order step of the non-linear iterative upwind advection MPDATA schemes (non-oscillatory forward in time), the divergence part of the matrix-free linear operator formulation in the iterative Krylov scheme, tridiagonal Thomas algorithm for vertical matrix inversion inside preconditioner for the iterative solver, and computation of the pseudovelocity for the second pass of upwind algorithm in MPDATA. All the kernels use 3-dimensional compute domain consisted from 7 to 11 arrays. Since all the kernels belong to the group of memory bound algorithms, our main challenge is to provide the highest utilization of global memory bandwidth. In this work we present FPGA as a powerful device to accelerate HPC codes. The proposed adaptation is compared with a CPU implementation that was strongly optimized in order to provide realistic and objective benchmarks. Our adaptation allows us to reduce the execution time up to 40% and the energy consumption up to 80% compared to the CPU processors."

OpenCL 2.0 defined a \u201cpipe\u201d feature to expose the FIFO construct, but the design didn\u2019t meet all needs of spatial architectures.  This talk describes a pipes extension to the Khronos SYCL single-source, C++-based programming framework, that exposes a pipe abstraction which closes the gaps in the OpenCL design, while also offering a more usable interface.  The C++ type system is leveraged to provide static connectivity guarantees without extensive compiler implementation effort, and to provide well-defined interaction with C++ features.  The described extension provides a usable interface that can also act as a substrate for additional abstractions to be built on top.  This talk will motivate the utility of FIFOs/pipes in high level language FPGA design, describe the SYCL pipes extension and its mapping to SPIR-V and OpenCL, and provide examples of use in common spatial design patterns."

      "description": "The use of reconfigurable computing, and FPGAs in particular, to accelerate computational kernels has the potential to be of great benefit to scientific codes and the HPC community in general. However, whilst recent advanced in FPGA tooling have made the physical act of programming reconfigurable architectures much more accessible, in order to gain good performance the entire algorithm must be rethought and recast in a dataflow style. Reducing the cost of data movement for all computing devices is critically important, and in this paper we explore the most appropriate techniques for FPGAs. We do this by describing the optimisation of an existing FPGA implementation of an atmospheric model's advection scheme. By taking an FPGA code that was over four times slower than running on the CPU, mainly due to data movement overhead, we describe the profiling and optimisation strategies adopted to significantly reduce the runtime and bring the performance of our FPGA kernels to a much more practical level for real-world use. The result of this work is a set of techniques, steps, and lessons learnt that we have found significantly improves the performance of FPGA based HPC codes and that others can adopt in their own codes to achieve similar results."

      "description": "Supported by their high power efficiency and recent advancements in High Level Synthesis (HLS), FPGAs are quickly finding their way into HPC and cloud systems. Large amounts of work have been done so far on loop and area optimizations for different applications on FPGAs using HLS. However, a comprehensive analysis of the behavior and efficiency of the memory controller of FPGAs is missing in literature, which becomes even more crucial when the limited memory bandwidth of modern FPGAs compared to their GPU counterparts is taken into account. In this work, we will analyze the memory interface generated by Intel FPGA SDK for OpenCL with different configurations for input/output arrays, vector size, interleaving, kernel programming model, on-chip channels, operating frequency, padding, and multiple types of overlapped blocking. Our results point to multiple shortcomings in the memory controller of Intel FPGAs, especially with respect to memory access alignment, that can hinder the programmer\u2019s ability in maximizing memory performance in their design. For some of these cases, we will provide work-arounds to improve memory bandwidth efficiency; however, a general solution will require major changes in the memory controller itself."

      "description": "Efficient prototyping of a large complex system can be significantly facilitated by the use of a flexible and versatile physical platform where both new hardware and software components can readily be implemented and tightly integrated in a timely manner. Towards this end, we have developed the 120\u0002130 mm QFDB board and associated firmware, including the system software environment. We developed a large system based on this advanced dense and modular building block. The QFDB features 4 interconnected Xilinx Zynq Ultrascale+ devices, each one consisting of an ARM-based subsystem tightly coupled with reconfigurable logic. Each Zynq Ultrascale+ is connected to 16 GB of DDR4 memory. In addition, one Zynq provides storage through an M.2 Solid State Disk (SSD). In this paper, we present the design and the implementation of this board, as well as the software environment for board operation. Moreover, we describe a 10 Gb Ethernet communication infrastructure for interconnecting multiple boards together. Finally, we highlight the impact of this board on a number of ongoing research activities that leverage the QFDB versatility, both as a large scale prototyping system for HPC solutions, and as a host for the development of FPGA integration techniques."

In practice, these devices are often not considered in the high-performance computing community, due to the steep learning curve and low productivity of hardware design, and the lack of available library support for fundamental operations.  We present FBLAS, an open source implementation of Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines (BLAS) for FPGAs.  The library is implemented with a modern HLS tool to promote productivity, reusability, and maintainability.  Numerical routines are designed to be easily composed exploiting on-chip connections, to reduce off-chip communication resulting in lower communication volume."

      "description": "The emergence of quantum computers in the last decade has generated research interest in applications such as quantum sorting. Quantum sorting plays a critical role in creating ordered sets of data that can be better utilized, e.g., quantum ordered search or quantum network switching.  In this paper, we propose a quantum sorting algorithm that combines highly parallelizable bitonic merge networks with perfect shuffle permutations (PSP), for sorting data represented in the quantum domain. The combination of bitonic networks with PSP improves the temporal complexity of bitonic merge sorting which is critical for reducing decoherence effects for quantum processing. We present space-efficient quantum circuits that can be used for quantum bit comparison and permutation.  We also present a reconfigurable hardware quantum emulator for prototyping the proposed quantum algorithm. The emulator has a fully-pipelined architecture and supports double-precision floating-point computations, resulting in high throughput and accuracy. The proposed hardware architectures are implemented on a high-performance reconfigurable computer (HPRC). In our experiments, we emulated quantum sorting circuits of up to 31 fully-entangled quantum bits on a single FPGA node of the HPRC platform. To the best of our knowledge, our effort is the first to investigate a reconfigurable hardware emulation of quantum sorting using bitonic networks and perfect shuffle."

      "description": "Reverse time migration (RTM) modeling is a computationally intensive component in the seismic processing workflow of oil and gas exploration, often demanding the manipulation of terabytes of data. Therefore, the computational kernels of the RTM algorithms need to access a large range of memory locations. However, most of these accesses result in cache misses, degrading the overall system performance. GPGPUs and FPGAs are the two endpoints in the spectrum of acceleration platforms, since both can achieve better performance in comparison to CPU on several high-performance applications. Recent literature highlights FPGA better energy efficiency when compared to GPGPU. The present work proposes a FPGA accelerated platform prototype targeting the computation of the RTM algorithm on an HPC environment. Experimental results highlight that speedups of 112x can be achieved, when compared to a sequential execution on CPU. When compared to a GPU, the power consumption has been reduced up to 55%."

      "description": "Transferring big data over Wide Area Networks (WANs) is challenging because optimization is dependent on the specifics of multiple parameters. Network services, paths, and technologies have different characteristics, including loss rate, latency, and available capacity. Yet, frameworks currently used to configure and orchestrate transfer systems, measure performance, and analyze results have limited capabilities. We propose a framework, DTN-as-a-Service (DaaS), for high-performance network data transfers using and integration of techniques, including virtualization, network provisioning, and performance data analysis. This framework has a modular design for supporting multiple transfer tools, optimizers and orchestrators for the data transfer environment, including Docker and Kubernetes. We present a Jupyter based workflow for high-speed network data transfer in data-intensive science and evaluate the performance of the transfer with a simple programmable visualizer implemented in the framework. With the increase in the number and the capacity of WAN links at the conferences (multiple 100 Gbps WAN circuits), the challenges involved in setting up, testing, debugging, verifying and running applications on high-performance systems connecting to the conference SCinet WAN circuits also increase. The SCinet implementation of the DaaS framework for the conference community allowed users to control hardware, software, and network infrastructure for high-speed network data transfer, primarily for large scale applications. Through the evaluation of the framework in our test setup, we demonstrated that NVMe over Fabrics with TCP is twice as efficient compared to using conventional TCP in high-speed NVMe-to-NVMe transfers. We also implemented a 400 Gbps LAN experiment to evaluate the DaaS framework."

While this phenomenon provides the opportunity for network operators to add resiliency to the global R&E fabric, it also adds complexity to network management and traffic engineering. <br>Software Defined Exchange points (SDX) provide enhanced capabilities to simplify flow-management and enable new network services.  Unlike traditional exchange points, an SDX controller has global visibility of the network topology, making it possible to maintain related states for the full path of a flow.  This presentation will describe what an SDX is and why SDXs are relevant to scientific workflows in the global R&E network fabric. The AtlanticWave-SDX project and its SDX controller will be presented as a novel distributed programmable controller along with use cases for two science drivers.  Results from extensive experiments in a testbed will be presented that demonstrate the AtlanticWave-SDX controller\u2019s high performance in terms of scalability, response time, and resource utilization, which are extremely important to support advanced scientific applications. Finally, future work will be described to clarify where SDXs can have an impact on the global R&E network fabric."

      "description": "Scientific computations are expected to be increasingly distributed across wide-area networks, and Message Passing Interface (MPI) has been shown to scale to support their communications over long distances. The execution times of MPI basic operations over long distance connections reflect the connection length and losses, which should be accounted for by the applications, for example, by rolling back to a single site under high network loss conditions. We utilize execution time measurements of MPI_Sendrecv operations collected over emulated 10Gbps connections with 0-366ms round-trip times, wherein the longest connection spans the globe, under up to 20\\% periodic losses. We describe five machine leaning methods to estimate the connection RTT and loss rate from these MPI execution times. They provide disparate, namely, linear and non-linear, and smooth and non-smooth, estimators of RTT and loss rate. Our results show that accurate estimates can be generated at low loss rates but become inaccurate at loss rates 10% and higher. Overall, these results constitute a case study of the strengths and limitations of machine learning methods in inferring network-level parameters using application-level measurements."

It has become a critical task for Cloud Service Providers (CSP) to fully utilize the expensive bandwidth resources of the links connecting such data centers while guaranteeing users\u2019 Quality of Experience (QoE). Most high-performance networks based on software-defined networking (SDN) provide the capability of advance bandwidth reservation. This paper focuses on the scheduling of multiple user requests of two different types with different priorities, namely, advance bandwidth reservation with a lower priority and immediate bandwidth reservation with a higher priority, to maximize the total satisfaction of user requests.We formulate this co-scheduling problem as a generic optimization problem, which is shown to be NP-complete. We design a heuristic algorithm to maximize the number of successfully scheduled requests and minimize the number of preempted advance reservation requests, while minimizing the completion time of each request. Extensive simulation results show that our scheduling scheme significantly outperforms greedy approaches in terms of user satisfaction degree."

      "description": "Full information on the path travelled by packets is extremely important for network management and network security. We implemented two path tracking methods in hardware with P4. The first approach  tracks a packet\u2019s path by recording each node along the path of a packet (hop recording). The complete path a packet took can be extracted from the packet in the last node of the path. The second approach tracks a packet\u2019s path by logging the forwarding state of a network (forwarding state logging).  The complete path can be reconstructed based on the node where the packet entered a network. We conducted experiments with the two implemented approaches and showed that the paths of the packets are reconstructed correctly. The advantage of using P4 is that the control plane only gets involved when the path of a packet is reconstructed. We finally show how our work provides a working tool in P4 networks that can be used to gain deep insights in traffic patterns."

      "description": "Congestion control algorithms for data networks have been the subject of intense research for the last three decades. While most of the work has focused around the characterization of a flow's bottleneck link, understanding the interactions amongst links and the ripple effects that perturbations in a link can cause on the rest of the network has remained much less understood. The Theory of Bottleneck Ordering is a recently developed mathematical framework that reveals the bottleneck structure of a network and provides a model to understand such effects. In this paper we present G2, the first operational network optimization framework that utilizes this new theoretical framework to characterize with high-precision the performance of bottlenecks and flows. G2 generates an interactive graph structure that describes how perturbations in links and flows propagate, providing operators new optimization insights and traffic engineering recommendations to help improve network performance. We provide a description of the G2 implementation and a set of experiments using real TCP/IP code to demonstrate its operational efficacy."

The monitoring and control of network parameters such as QoS policy assignment in access networks, modulation and symbol rate adjustments in optical networks, packet filtering and anomaly detection in security networks, beam-forming and scheduling in 5G wireless networks is extremely complex and challenging. Machine learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be used to perform proactive prediction and adjustment from learned behavior in next generation networks to achieve high efficiency and reliability in networks. This session discusses the applications of machine learning in next generation networks and provides an overview of how machine learning models (supervised, unsupervised or recurrent) deployed on a programmable hardware can help to build automated, efficient and resilient next generation networks."

      "description": "Identifying network anomalies is an important measure to ensure reliability and quality of data transfers among facilities. Scientific workflows in particular heavily rely on good network performance to ensure their smooth executions. In this paper, we present a lightweight classifier system that is able to recognize anomalous TCP transfers. Using random forest trees and labeled data sets, we evaluate the classifier with real workflow transfers for ground truth data. Our studies reveal that various TCP congestion algorithms behave differently in anomalous conditions. We show that training classifiers on these separately can aid detection in network performance deterioration. Results reveal that our classifiers are able to better predict anomalous flows for TCP Reno and Hamilton compared to Cubic and BBR, due to the manner how their congestion control algorithms handle the anomalies."

      "description": "Transfer configurations play a crucial role in achieving desirable performance in high-speed networks where suboptimal settings could lead to poor transfer throughput. However, discovering the optimal configuration for a given transfer task is a difficult problem as it depends on various factors including dataset characteristics and network settings. The state-of-the-art transfer tuning solutions rely on sample transfers and evaluate different transfer configurations in attempt to discover the optimal one in real-time. Yet, current approaches to run sample transfers incur significant delay and measurement errors, thus limit the gain offered by tuning algorithms. In this paper, we take advantage of feed forward deep neural network (DNN) to minimize execution time of sample transfers without sacrificing measurement accuracy. To achieve this goal, we collected 115K data transfer logs in four networks and trained multiple DNNs that can predict convergence time of transfers by analyzing real-time throughput metrics. The results gathered in various networks with rich set of transfer configurations indicate that DNN can reduce error rate by up to 50% compared to the state-of-the-art solution while achieving similar sample transfer execution time in most cases. Moreover, by tuning its hyperparameters and model settings, one can achieve low execution time and error rate based on the specific needs of the user or application."

      "description": "Supercomputers are becoming increasingly complex due to the prevalence of hierarchy and heterogeneity in emerging node and system architectures.  As a result of these trends, users of conventional programming models for scalable high-performance applications increasingly find themselves writing applications using a mix of distinct programming models\u2014such as Fortran90, C, C++, MPI, OpenMP, and CUDA\u2014which are also often becoming more complex and detail-oriented themselves.  These trends negatively impact the costs of developing, porting, and maintaining HPC applications.<br><br>Meanwhile, new programming models and languages are being developed that strive to improve upon the status quo by unifying the expression of parallelism and locality across the system, raising the level of abstraction, making use of modern language design features, and/or leveraging the respective strengths of programmers, compilers, runtimes, and operating systems.  These alternatives may take the form of parallel programming languages (e.g., Chapel, Fortran 2018, Julia, UPC), frameworks for large-scale data processing and analytics (e.g., Spark, Tensorflow, Dask), or libraries and embedded DSLs that extend existing languages (e.g., Legion, COMPSs, SHMEM, HPX, Charm++, UPC++, Coarray C++, Global Arrays).<br><br>The PAW-ATM workshop is designed to explore the expression of applications in scalable parallel programming models that serve as an alternative to the status quo.  It is designed to bring together applications experts and proponents of high-level programming models to present concrete and practical examples of using such alternative models and to illustrate the benefits of high-level approaches to scalable programming."

      "description": "The Predictive Science Academic Alliance Program (PSAAP) II at Stanford University is developing an Exascale-ready multi-physics solver to investigate particle-laden turbulent flows in a radiation environment for solar energy receiver applications. In order to simulate the proposed concentrated particle-based receiver design three distinct but coupled physical phenomena must be modeled: fluid flows, Lagrangian particle dynamics, and the transport of thermal radiation. Therefore, three different physics solvers (fluid, particles, and radiation) must run concurrently with significant cross-communication in an integrated multi-physics simulation. However, each solver uses substantially different algorithms and data access patterns. Coordinating the overall data communication, computational load balancing, and scaling these different physics solvers together on modern massively parallel, heterogeneous high performance computing systems presents several major challenges. We have adopted the Legion programming system, via the Regent programming language, and its task parallel programming model to address these challenges. Our multi-physics solver Soleil-X is written entirely in the high level Regent programming language and is one of the largest and most complex applications written in Regent to date. At this workshop we will give an overview of the software architecture of Soleil-X as well as discuss how our multi-physics solver was designed to use the task parallel programming model provided by Legion. We will also discuss the development experience, scaling, performance, portability, and multi-physics simulation results."

      "description": "Programmability is one of the key challenges of Exascale Computing. Using the actor model for distributed computations may be one solution. The actor model separates computation from communication while still enabling their overlap. Each actor possesses specified communication endpoints to publish and receive information. Computations are undertaken based on the data available on these channels. We present a library that implements this programming model using UPC++, and evaluate three different parallelization strategies, one based on rank-sequential execution, one based on multiple threads in a rank, and one based on OpenMP tasks. In an evaluation of our library using shallow water proxy applications, our solution compares favorably against an earlier implementation based on X10, and a BSP-based approach."

Training these large neural networks is computationally intensive and is often parallelized to shorten training times that could otherwise range from days to weeks. The Message Passing Interface (MPI) communication model has been commonly used to facilitate the data exchange and synchronization required for parallel DNN training. We observe that OpenSHMEM supports many of the same communication operations as MPI \u2014 in particular, the all-reduce operation needed to support data parallelism \u2014 and that OpenSHMEM may further provide a unique solution to fine-grain model parallel computation. In this work, we present an initial evaluation of OpenSHMEM\u2019s suitability for use in DNN training and compare its performance with MPI. Results indicate that OpenSHMEM data-parallel performance is comparable with MPI. The usage of OpenSHMEM to support model parallelism will be explored<br>in our future work."

The OpenSHMEM specification standardizes the library interfaces, prioritizing a performant and portable API. The specification continues to mature with vigorous support from several authoritative vendors and researchers. For example, the OpenSHMEM specification committee is actively standardizing a unique teams API that enables user-defined subsets of application processes to efficiently and productively perform communication operations, such as collectives routines, remote memory accesses, and remote atomic operations.<br><br>This paper describes the OpenSHMEM teams interface and several interesting aspects and challenges in implementing the API, as well as possible extensions that could improve the programmability and/or performance. We evaluate the performance of a preliminary implementation and show that using teams effectively can facilitate impressive improvements of collective operations at scale, even while simplifying the underlying programming model."

      "description": "As the number of shared-memory cores per node in modern High Performance Computing (HPC) machines continues to grow, hybrid programming models like MPI+threads are becoming a preferred choice for scientific applications. While being able to utilize computation resources efficiently, threads in hybrid applications often compete with each other for communication resources, resulting in a negative impact on performance. The OpenSHMEM distributed programming model provides communication context objects that can be used to provide threads with isolated access to the network, thus reducing contention. In this work, we discuss a design for OpenSHMEM contexts and an implementation of the context construct to support hybrid multi-threaded applications and evaluate the performance of the implementation. In all our micro-benchmarks, threads show nearly identical communication performance compared to single-threaded OpenSHMEM processes. By using contexts in hybrid benchmarks, we have achieved up to 43.1% performance improvement for 3D halo exchange, 339% improvement for all-to-all communication, and 35.4% improvement for inter-node load balancing."

Furthermore, we show that the dynamic nature of Python permits the implementation of several key optimizations (index launches, futures, mapping) currently implemented in the Regent compiler. Together these features enable Pygion code that is comparable in expressiveness to Regent, but more flexible, and substantially more concise, less error prone, and easier to use than C++ Legion code. We show that, in combination with high-performance kernels written in the Regent programming language, Pygion is able to achieve efficient, scalable execution on up to 1024 nodes of the heterogeneous supercomputer Piz Daint."

As a result of these trends, users of conventional programming models for scalable high-performance applications increasingly find themselves writing applications using a mix of distinct programming models\u2014such as Fortran90, C, C++, MPI, OpenMP, and CUDA\u2014which are also often becoming more complex and detail-oriented themselves. These trends negatively impact the costs of developing, porting, and maintaining HPC applications.<br><br>Meanwhile, new programming models and languages are being developed that strive to improve upon the status quo by unifying the expression of parallelism and locality across the system, raising the level of abstraction, making use of modern language design features, and/or leveraging the respective strengths of programmers, compilers, runtimes, and operating systems. These alternatives may take the form of parallel programming languages (e.g., Chapel, Fortran 2018, Julia, UPC), frameworks for large-scale data processing and analytics (e.g., Spark, Tensorflow, Dask), or libraries and embedded DSLs that extend existing languages (e.g., Legion, COMPSs, SHMEM, HPX, Charm++, UPC++, Coarray C++, Global Arrays).<br><br>The PAW-ATM workshop is designed to explore the expression of applications in scalable parallel programming models that serve as an alternative to the status quo. It is designed to bring together applications experts and proponents of high-level programming models to present concrete and practical examples of using such alternative models and to illustrate the benefits of high-level approaches to scalable programming.<br><br><a href=\"http://sourceryinstitute.github.io/PAW/\" target=\"_blank\"> http://sourceryinstitute.github.io/PAW/</a>"

      "description": "High-performance computing has become central for empowering scientific progress in the most fundamental research in various academic and business domains. It is remarkable to observe that the rapid advancement in the mainstream computing technology has facilitated the ability to solve complex, large-scale scientific applications that perform advanced simulations of the implementation of various numerical models pertaining to diverse fields. However, the inherent wide distribution, heterogeneity, and dynamism of the  current  and emerging computing and software environments increasingly challenge cyberinfrastructure facilitators, trainers and educators.  The challenge is how to support and train the diverse current users and prepare the future educators, researchers, developers and policymakers to keep pace with the rapidly evolving HPC environments to advance discovery and economic competitiveness for many generations.<br> <br>Since 2014, the Best Practices for HPC Training Workshop at SC has been successful in creating a global platform for addressing common challenges for enhancing HPC training and education and for numerous sharing and collaborating opportunities across the globe. The sixth annual full-day workshop on HPC training and education is an ACM SIGHPC Education Chapter coordinated effort, aimed at fostering more collaborations among the practitioners from traditional and emerging fields to explore educational needs in HPC, to develop and deploy HPC training, and to identify new challenges and opportunities for latest HPC platforms. The workshop will also be a platform for disseminating results and lessons learned in these areas and will be captured in a Special Edition of the Journal of Computational Science Education."

      "description": "OpenMP is one of the most popular programming models to exploit node-level parallelism of supercomputers. Many researchers are interested in developing OpenMP compilers or extending existing standard for new capabilities. However, there is a lack of training resources for researchers who are involved in the compiler and language development around OpenMP, making learning curve in this area steep. <br><br>In this paper, we introduce an ongoing effort, FreeCompilerCamp.org, a free and open online learning platform aimed to train researchers to quickly develop OpenMP compilers. The platform is built on top of Play-With-Docker, a docker playground for users to conduct experiments in an online terminal sandbox. It provides a live training website that is set up on cloud, so anyone with internet access and a web browser will be able to take the training. It also enables developers with relevant skills to contribute new tutorials. The entire training system is open-source and can be deployed on a private server, workstation or even laptop for personal use. We have created some initial tutorials to train users to learn how to extend the Clang/LLVM and ROSE compiler to support new OpenMP features. We welcome anyone to try out our system, give us feedback, contribute new training courses, or enhance the training platform to make it an effective learning resource for the HPC community."

These modules have been offered twice as a 10-week graduate course in an engineering program, although the content applies broadly to any field of scientific and/or engineering research where software may be developed. Topics taught include local and remote version control, licensing and copyright, structuring Python modules, testing and test coverage, continuous integration, packaging and distribution, open science, introduction to parallelism, software citation, and reproducibility basics, among others. Lectures are supplemented by in-class activities and discussions, and all course material is shared openly via GitHub. In the 10-week course, student work is heavily based on a single, term-long project where students individually develop a software package targeted at their own research topic; all contributions must be submitted as pull requests and reviewed/merged by other students. The course was offered in 2018 and 2019 to 24 students total, and shorter-length workshops will also be offered."

Founded in 2015, CMSE recognizes computation as the \"triple junction\" of algorithm development and analysis, high performance computing, and applications to scientific and engineering modeling and data science (as illustrated in Figure 1). This approach is designed to engage with computation as a new integrated discipline, rather than a series of decentralized, isolated sub-specialties. In the four years since its inception, the department has grown and flourished; however, the pathway was sometimes arduous. This paper shares lessons learned during the department\u2019s development and the initiatives it has taken on to support computational research and education across the university.  By sharing these lessons, we hope to encourage and support the foundation of similar departments at other universities and grow this integrated style discipline as a new profession."

In the past decade, high-performance computing has also contributed significantly to addressing complex problems in bioengineering, healthcare and systems biology. Therefore, computational biology applications provide several compelling examples that can be potent pedagogical tools in teaching high-performance computing. In this paper, we introduce a novel course curriculum to teach high-performance, parallel and distributed computing to senior graduate students (PhD) in a hands-on setup through examples drawn from a wealth of areas in computational biology. We introduce the concepts of parallel programming, algorithms and architectures and implementations via carefully chosen examples from computational biology. We believe that this course curriculum will provide students an engaging and refreshing introduction to these well-established domains."

This talk provides information on a training model that has been adopted at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC) at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL). As a computational facility that have onsite staff 24/7, staff are trained with required technical understanding and independent thought to resolve problems to bring the facility resources back to normal operation.<br><br>Most education systems focus on one or two of these areas. The model involves working with the school and curriculum to provide the basic education required. Students are placed in an internship to demonstrate their knowledge of these areas but also direct their training toward the HPC area. Completion of an internship can lead to the one-year apprenticeship program which is milestone based and meant to direct the apprentice to master each of the skill areas to prepare to meet the minimum qualifications of a Site Reliability Engineer at a computational facility. NERSC has seen success from this program and has created a workforce pipeline from schools into a potential career position."

      "description": "While strides have been made to improve science and math readiness at a college-preparatory level, some key fundamentals have been left unaddressed that can cause students to turn away from the STEM disciplines before they find their niche. Introducing collegiate level research and project-based, group-centered learning at a high school level has a multi-faceted effect; in addition to elevated learning outcomes in science and math, students exhibit improved critical thinking and communication skills, leading to improved preparedness for subsequent academic endeavors. The work presented here outlines the development of a STEM ecosystem where both the science department and math department have implemented an interdisciplinary approach to introduce a spectrum of laboratory and computing research skills. This takes the form of both \"in situ,\" micro-curricular elements and stand-alone research and computer science classes which integrate the language-independent concepts of abstraction and object-oriented programming, distributed and high-performance computing, and high and low level language control applications. This pipeline has been an effective tool that has allowed several driven and interested students to participated in collegiate-level and joint-collegiate projects involving virtual reality, robotics and systems controls, and modeling.  The willingness of the departments to cross-pollinate, hire faculty well-versed in research, and support students and faculty with the proper resources are critical factors in readying the next generation of computing leaders."

The learning objectives include the foundations of High-Performance Computing (HPC), such as the understanding of modern architectures, the development of parallel programming skills, and course-specific topics, like accelerator programming or cluster set-up.<br><br>In order to execute the labs successfully with limited personnel resources and still provide students with access to world-class HPC architectures, we developed a set of concepts to motivate students and to track their progress. This includes the learning status survey and the developer diary, which are presented in this work. We also report on our experiences with using innovative teaching concepts to incentivize students to optimize their codes, such as using competition among the groups. Our concepts enable us to track the effectiveness of our labs and to steer them for increasing sizes of diverse students.<br><br>We conclude that software labs are effective in adding practical experiences to HPC education. Our approach to hand out open tasks and to leave creative freedom in implementing the solutions enables the students to self-pace their learning process and to vary their investment of effort during the semester. Our effort and progress tracking ensures the achieving of the extensive learning objectives and enables our research on HPC programming productivity."

      "description": "Developments in large scale computing  environments have led to design of workflows that rely on containers and analytics platform that are well supported by the commercial cloud. The National Science Foundation also envisions a future in science and engineering that includes commercial cloud service providers (CSPs) such as Amazon Web Services, Azure and Google Cloud. These twin forces have made researchers consider the commercial cloud as an alternative option to current high performance computing (HPC) environments. Training and knowledge on how to migrate workflows, cost-control, data-management, and system administration remain some of the commonly listed concerns with adoption of cloud computing.  In an effort to ameliorate this situation, CSPs have developed online and in-person training platforms to help address this problem.  Scalability, ability to impart knowledge, evaluating knowledge gain, and accreditation are the core concepts that have driven this approach. Here, we present a review of our experience using Google\u2019s Qwiklabs online platform for remote and in-person training from the perspective of a HPC user.  For this study, we completed over 50 online courses, earned five badges and attended a one-day session. Here, we identify the strengths of the approach, identify avenues to refine them, and consider means to further community engagement.  We further evaluate the readiness of these resources for a cloud-curious researcher who is familiar with HPC.  Finally, we present recommendations on how the large scale computing community can leverage these opportunities to work with CSPs to assist researchers nationally and at their home institutions."

It is remarkable to observe that the rapid advancement in the mainstream computing technology has facilitated the ability to solve complex, large-scale scientific applications that perform advanced simulations of the implementation of various numerical models pertaining to diverse fields. However, the inherent wide distribution, heterogeneity, and dynamism of the current and emerging computing and software environments increasingly challenge cyberinfrastructure facilitators, trainers and educators. The challenge is how to support and train the diverse current users and prepare the future educators, researchers, developers and policymakers to keep pace with the rapidly evolving HPC environments to advance discovery and economic competitiveness for many generations.<br><br>Since 2014, the Best Practices for HPC Training Workshop at SC has been successful in creating a global platform for addressing common challenges for enhancing HPC training and education and for numerous sharing and collaborating opportunities across the globe. The sixth annual full-day workshop on HPC training and education is an ACM SIGHPC Education Chapter coordinated effort, aimed at fostering more collaborations among the practitioners from traditional and emerging fields to explore educational needs in HPC, to develop and deploy HPC training, and to identify new challenges and opportunities for latest HPC platforms.

The second motivation is that the in situ methodology can enable scientific discovery from a broad range of data sources\u2014HPC simulations, experiments, scientific instruments, and sensor networks\u2014over a wide scale of computing platforms: leadership-class HPC, clusters, clouds, workstations, and embedded devices at the edge.<br><br>The successful development of in situ data management capabilities can potentially benefit real-time decision making, design optimization, and data-driven scientific discovery. This talk will feature six priority research directions that highlight the components and capabilities needed for in situ data management to be successful for a wide variety of applications: making in situ data management more pervasive, controllable, composable, and transparent, with a focus on greater coordination with the software stack, and a diversity of fundamentally new data algorithms."

      "description": "Machine Learning (ML) has become essential in several industries. In Computational Science and Engineering (CSE), the complexity of the ML lifecycle comes from the large variety of data, scientists' expertise, tools, and workflows. If data are not tracked properly during the lifecycle, it becomes unfeasible to recreate a ML model from scratch or to explain to stackholders how it was created. The main limitation of provenance tracking solutions is that they cannot cope with provenance capture and integration of domain and ML data processed in the multiple workflows in the lifecycle, while keeping the provenance capture overhead low. To handle this problem, in this paper we contribute with a detailed characterization of provenance data in the ML lifecycle in CSE; a new provenance data representation, called PROV-ML, built on top of W3C PROV and ML Schema; and extensions to a system that tracks provenance from multiple workflows to address the characteristics of ML and CSE, and to allow for provenance queries with a standard vocabulary. We show a practical use in a real case in the O&G industry, along with its evaluation using 239,616 CUDA cores in parallel."

We describe Cheetah, a new framework for performing parametric studies on coupled applications. Cheetah facilitates understanding the impact of various factors such as process placement, synchronicity of algorithms, and storage vs. compute requirements for online analysis of large data. Ultimately, we aim to create a catalog of performance results that can help scientists understand tradeoffs when designing next-generation simulations that make use of online processing techniques. We illustrate the design choices of Cheetah by using a reaction-diffusion simulation (Gray-Scott) paired with an analysis application to demonstrate initial results of fine-grained process placement on Summit, a pre-exascale supercomputer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory."

      "description": "Scientific workflows are well established in parallel computing. A workflow represents a conceptual description of work items and their dependencies. Researchers can use workflows to abstract away implementation details or resources to focus on the high-level behavior of their work items. Due to these abstractions and the complexity of scientific workflows, finding performance bottlenecks along with their root causes can quickly become involving. This work presents a top-down methodology for performance analysis of workflows to support users in this challenging task. Our work provides summarized performance metrics covering different workflow perspectives, from general overview to individual jobs and their job steps. These summaries allow to identify inefficiencies and determine the responsible job steps. In addition, we record detailed performance data about job steps, enabling a fine-grained analysis of the associated execution to exactly pinpoint performance issues. The introduced methodology provides a powerful tool for comprehensive performance analysis of complex workflows."

      "description": "The promise of an easy access to a virtually unlimited number of resources makes Infrastructure as a Service Clouds a good candidate for the execution of data-intensive workflow applications composed of hundreds of computational tasks. Thanks to a careful execution planning, Workflow Management Systems can build a tailored compute infrastructure by combining a set of virtual machine instances. However, these applications usually rely on files to handle dependencies between tasks. A storage space shared by all virtual machines may become a bottleneck and badly impact the application execution time. <br><br>In this paper, we propose an original data-aware planning algorithm that leverages two characteristics of a family of virtual machines instances, i.e., a large number of cores and a dedicated storage space on fast SSD drives, to improve data locality, hence reducing the amount of data transfers over the network during the execution of a workflow. We also propose a simulation-driven approach to solve a cost-performance optimization problem and correctly dimension the virtual infrastructure onto which execute a given workflow. Experiments conducted with real application workflows show the benefits of the presented algorithms. The data-aware planning leads to a clear reduction of both execution time and volume of data transferred over the network while the simulation-driven approach allows us to dimension the infrastructure in a reasonable time."

      "description": "There has been a recent emergence of new workflow applications focused on data analytics and machine learning. This emergence has precipitated a change in the workflow management landscape, causing the development of new data-oriented workflow management systems (WMSs) as opposed to the earlier standard of task-oriented WMSs. In this paper, we summarize three general workflow use-cases and explore the unique requirements of each use-case in order to understand how WMSs from both workflow management models (task-driven workflow management models and data-driven workflow management models) meet the requirements of each workflow use-case from the user's perspective. We analyze the applicability of <br>the two main workflow models by carefully describing each model and by providing an examination of the different variations of WMSs that fall under the task-driven model. To illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of each workflow management model, we summarize the key features of four production-ready WMSs: Pegasus, Makeflow, Apache Airflow, and Pachyderm. Of these production-ready WMSs, three belong to the task-driven workflow management model (i.e., Pegasus, Makeflow, Apache Airflow) and one belongs to the data-driven workflow management model (i.e., Pachyderm). To deepen our analysis of the four WMSs examined in this paper, we implement three real-world use-cases to highlight the specifications and features of each WMS. The application of these real-world use-cases demonstrates how each workflow management model operates with the <br>different applications. We present our final assessment of each WMS after considering the following factors: usability, performance, ease of deployment, <br>and relevance. The purpose of this work is to offer insights from the user's perspective into the research challenges that WMSs currently face due to the <br>evolving workflow landscape."

The issue highlights some of the activities and approaches that are underway in the scientific workflow community. Scientific workflows evolved as a way to manage computation on High Performance Computing (HPC) and distributed systems. Early workflow efforts started as domain-specific efforts that managed directed acyclic graphs on high-performance and distributed systems. They considered the systems and the applications as black boxes and focused on distributed resource management, workload, and execution management."

As modern HPC systems embark on a trend toward extreme heterogeneity leveraging multiple GPUs per node, power management becomes even more challenging, especially when catering to scientific workflows with co-scheduled components. The impact of managing GPU power on workflow performance and run-to-run reproducibility has not been adequately studied. <br><br>In this paper, we present a first-of-its-kind research to study the impact of the two power management knobs that are available on NVIDIA Volta GPUs: frequency capping and power capping. We analyzed performance and power metrics of GPU\u2019s on a top-10 supercomputer by tuning these knobs for more than 5,300 runs in a scientific workflow. Our data found that GPU power capping in a scientific workflow is an effective way of improving power efficiency while preserving performance, while GPU frequency capping is a demonstrably unpredictable way of reducing power consumption. Additionally, we identified that frequency capping results in higher variation and anomalous behavior on GPUs, which is counterintuitive to what has been observed in the research conducted on CPUs."

      "description": "Material screening entails a large number of electronic structure simulations that solve the Kohn-Sham (KS) equations based on the high-throughput density functional theory. The computational efficiency for solving the KS equations, however, is largely dependent on the initial displacement of the particles. Traditionally, simulation runs are treated separately as solving independent KS equations with their own initial conditions. As such, one cannot take advantage of the potential correlation between different simulations. In this paper, we propose to explore the job inter-dependencies and formulate material screening as an inter-job scheduling problem. More specifically, We schedule the material screening jobs according to the potential correlation between them and run the simulations by reusing the particle distribution from previous runs as the initial condition. We propose a heuristic inter-job scheduling algorithm and compare that with an optimal case where the pair-wise correlation between different simulations is known {\\em a priori}. Experiments on the Sunway TaihuLight supercomputer show that the total time to run the large number of jobs in one practical material screening example is significantly reduced, by as much as 89%."

      "description": "Scientific workflows have enabled large-scale scientific computations and data analysis, and lowered the entry barrier for performing computations in distributed heterogeneous platforms (e.g., HTC and HPC). In spite of impressive achievements to date, large-scale modeling, simulation, and data analytics in the long-tail still face several challenges such as efficient scheduling and execution of large-scale workflows (O(10^6)) with very short-running tasks (few seconds). While the current trend to support next-generation workflows on leadership class machines have gained much attention in the past years, at the other end of the spectrum scientific workflows from the long-tail science have become larger and require processing massive volumes of data. In this paper, we report on our experience in designing and implementing an HTC workflow for agroecosystem modeling. We leverage well-known (task clustering and co-scheduling) and emerging (hierarchical workflows and containers) workflow optimization techniques to make the workflow planning problem tractable, and maximize resource utilization and the degree of task parallelism. Experimental results, via the implementation of a use case, show that by strategically combining the above strategies and defining an appropriate set of optimization parameters, the overall workflow makespan can be improved by 3.5 orders of magnitude when compared to a regular (non-optimized) execution of the workflow."

      "description": "In the past few years, neuroimaging has entered the Big Data era due to the joint increase in image resolution, data sharing, and study sizes. However, no particular Big Data engines have emerged in this field, and several alternatives remain available. We compare two popular Big Data engines with Python APIs, Apache Spark and <br>Dask, for their runtime performance in processing neuroimaging pipelines. Our evaluation uses two synthetic pipelines processing the 81GB BigBrain image, and a real pipeline processing anatomical data from more than 1,000 subjects. We benchmark these pipelines using various combinations of task durations, data sizes, and numbers of workers, deployed on an 8-node (8 cores ea.) compute cluster in Compute Canada's Arbutus cloud. We evaluate PySpark's RDD API against Dask's Bag, Delayed and Futures. Results show that despite slight differences between Spark and Dask, both engines perform comparably. However, Dask pipelines risk being limited by Python's GIL depending on task type and cluster configuration. In all cases, the major limiting factor was data transfer. While either engine is suitable for neuroimaging pipelines, more effort needs to be placed in reducing data transfer time."

      "description": "Frequent Itemset Mining (FIM) is a fundamental procedure in various data mining techniques such as association rule mining. Among many existing algorithms, FP-Growth is considered as a milestone achievement that discovers frequent itemsets without generating candidates. However, due to the high complexity of its mining process and the high cost of its memory usage, FP-Growth still suffers from a performance bottleneck when dealing with large datasets. In this paper, we design a new Array Prefix-Tree structure, and based on that, propose an Array Prefix-Tree Growth (APT-Growth) algorithm, which explicitly obviates the need of recursively constructing conditional FP-Tree as required by FP-Growth. To support big data analytics, we further design and implement a parallel version of APTGrowth, referred to as PAPT-Growth, as a Spark workflow. We conduct FIM workflow experiments on both real-life and synthetic datasets for performance evaluation, and extensive results show that PAPT-Growth outperforms other representative parallel FIM algorithms in terms of execution time, which sheds light on its potential applications to big data mining."

Workflows provide a systematic way of describing the analysis and rely on workflow management systems to execute the complex analyses on a variety of distributed resources. This workshop focuses on the many facets of data-intensive workflow management systems, ranging from job execution to service management and the coordination of data, service and job dependencies. The workshop therefore covers a broad range of issues in the scientific workflow lifecycle that include: data intensive workflows representation and enactment; designing workflow composition interfaces; workflow mapping techniques that may optimize the execution of the workflow; workflow enactment engines that need to deal with failures in the application and execution environment; and a number of computer science problems related to scientific workflows such as semantic technologies, compiler methods, fault detection and tolerance.<br><br><a href=\"http://works.cs.cardiff.ac.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">http://works.cs.cardiff.ac.uk/</a>"

SE researchers have developed tools and practices to support development tasks, including: requirements, design, validation and verification, testing, continuous integration, and maintenance. Because of the scale of HPC and HPDA, there is a need to adapt these SE tools/methods that are standard elsewhere.

Development and adoption of community codes is one way to address this challenge. The astrophysics community has been ahead of many other science communities in making research codes publicly available, and therefore in the development and adoption of community codes. ZEUS-2D was one of the earliest codes to become public, and it has been followed by several others.  A study of the landscape of publicly available software and their penetration in the research conducted by the community can provide important insight for other communities that are struggling with similar issues. In this paper we analyze a subset of software available in ASCL to understand a part of the landscape. The category of software that we focused on involves modeling of hydrodynamics. We use the citation history of the software for our analysis."

      "description": "The development of a high performance PDE solver requires the combined expertise of interdisciplinary teams w.r.t. application domain, numerical scheme and low-level optimization. In this paper, we present how the ExaHyPE engine facilitates the collaboration of such teams by isolating three roles -- application, algorithms, and optimization expert -- thus allowing team members to focus on their own area of expertise, while integrating their contributions into an HPC production code.<br><br>To do so, ExaHyPE takes inspiration from web application development practices and relies on two custom code generation modules, the Toolkit and the Kernel Generator, that follow a Model-View-Controller architectural pattern on top of the Jinja2 template engine library. By using Jinja2's templates to abstract the critical components of the engine and generated glue code, we isolate the application development from the engine. Furthermore the template language allows us to define and use custom macros that isolate low-level optimizations from the numerical scheme described in the templates.<br><br>We present three use cases, each focusing on one of our user roles, showcasing how the design of the code generation modules allows to easily expand the solver schemes to support novel demands from applications, to add optimized algorithmic schemes (with reduced memory footprint, e.g.), or provide improved low-level SIMD vectorization support."

In this work, we designed a new query language, named Feature Query Language (FQL), to collect and extract HPC-related software features or metadata from a quick static code analysis. We also designed and implemented an FQL-based toolkit to automatically detect and present software features using an extensible query repository. A number of large-scale, high performance computing (HPC) scientific applications have been studied in the paper with the FQL toolkit to demonstrate the HPC-related feature extraction and information/metadata collection. Different from the existing static software analysis and refactoring tools which focus on software debug, development and code transformation, the FQL toolkit is simpler, significantly lightweight and strives to collect various and diverse software metadata with ease and rapidly."

      "description": "Developers who build research software for High Performance Computing (HPC) or High Performance Data Analysis/Analytics (HPDA) face software engineering (SE) challenges at scales not often addressed by traditional SE approaches. For example, HPC and HPDA software developers must solve reliability, availability, and maintainability problems at extreme scales, consider reproducibility, understand domain specific constraints, deal with uncertainties inherent in scientific exploration, and efficiently use compute resources. SE researchers have developed tools and practices to support development tasks, including: requirements, design, validation and verification, testing, continuous integration, and maintenance. Because of the scale of HPC and HPDA, there is a need to adapt these SE tools/methods that are standard elsewhere. This workshop brings together members of the SE and HPC/HPDA communities to present findings relative to these problems and to generate an agenda to advance software engineering tools and practices for HPC/HPDA software.<br><br><a href=\"http://SE4Science.org/workshops/seher19/\" target=\"_blank\">http://SE4Science.org/workshops/seher19/</a>"

This requires our community to understand a clear yet complex relationships between application design, data analysis and reduction methods, programming models, system software, hardware, and other elements of a next-generation High Performance Computer, particularly given constraints such as applicability, fidelity, performance portability, and power efficiency.<br><br>There are at least three important topics that our community is striving to answer: (1) whether several orders of magnitude of data reduction is possible for exascale sciences; (2) understanding the performance and accuracy trade-off of data reduction; and (3) solutions to effectively reduce data while preserving the information hidden in large scientific data.  Tackling these challenges requires expertise from computer science, mathematics, and application domains to study the problem holistically, and develop solutions and hardened software tools that can be used by production applications."

      "description": "The cost of I/O is a significant challenge on current supercomputers, and the trend is likely to continue into the foreseeable future. This challenge is amplified in scientific visualization because of the requirement to consume large amounts of data before processing can begin. Lossy compression has become an important technique in reducing the cost of performing I/O. In this paper we consider the implications of using compressed data for visualization within a scientific workflow. We use visualization operations on simulation data that is reduced using three different state-of-the-art compression techniques. We study the storage efficiency and preservation of visualization features on the resulting compressed data, and draw comparisons between the three techniques used.  Our contributions can help inform both scientists and researchers in the use and design of compression techniques for preservation of important visualization details."

      "description": "Climate model simulations produce large volumes of data, and reducing the storage burden with data compression is increasingly of interest to climate scientists. A key concern to the climate community, though, is ensuring that any data loss due to compression does not in any way affect their scientific analysis. For this reason, the climate community is taking a cautious approach to adopting lossy compression by carefully investigating the potential existence of artifacts due to compression in a wide variety of analysis settings. Spatio-temporal statistical analysis in particular can highlight compression-induced features that would go unnoticed by the standard metrics common to the data compression community. Communicating such findings to the algorithm developers in the context of a collaborative improvement cycle is one \u2013 in our view productive \u2013 way to foster trust within the climate community and pave the way for eventual adoption of lossy compression. In this work, we report on the initial results of a successful and mutually beneficial collaboration between the two communities that led to improvements in a well regarded compression algorithm and more effective compression of climate simulation data."

      "description": "Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a tool for understanding data at scale. However, this new methodology comes at a cost because ML requires the use of even more HPC resources to generate ML algorithms. In addition to the compute resources required to develop ML algorithms, ML does not sidestep one of the biggest challenges on leading-edge HPC systems: the increasing gap between compute performance and I/O bandwidth. This has led to a strong push towards in situ, processing the data as it is generated, strategies to mitigate the I/O bottleneck. Unfortunately, there are no in situ frameworks dedicated to coupling scientific visualization and ML at scale to develop ML algorithms for scientific visualization.<br>    <br>To address the ML and in situ visualization gap, we introduce PAVE. PAVE is an in situ framework which addresses the data management needs between visualisation and machine learning tasks. We demonstrate our framework with a case study that accelerates physically-based light rendering, path-tracing, through the use of a conditional Generative Adversarial neural Network (cGAN). PAVE couples the training over path-traced images resulting in a generative model able to produce scene renderings with accurate light transport and global illumination of a quality comparable to offline approaches in a more efficient manner."

This places increased importance on the application to minimize the amount of time wasted due to recompution when recovering from a checkpoint. Typically HPC application checkpoint at iteration boundaries. However, for applications that have a high per-iteration cost, checkpointing inside the iteration limits the amount of re-computation. This paper analyzes the performance and accuracy of using lossy compressed check-pointing in the computational chemistry application NWChem. Our results indicate that lossy compression is an effective tool for reducing the sub-iteration checkpoint size. Moreover, compression error tolerances that yield acceptable deviation in accuracy and iteration count are quantified."

      "description": "Exploration using borehole drilling is a key activity in determining the most appropriate locations for the petroleum industry to develop oil fields. However estimating the amount of Oil In Place (OIP) relies on computing with a very significant number of geological models which, due to the ever increasing capability to capture and refine data, is becoming infeasible. As such data reduction techniques are required to reduce this set down to a much smaller yet still fully representative ensemble. In this paper we explore different approaches to identifying the key grouping of models, based on their most important features, and then using this information select a reduced set which we can be confident fully represent the overall model space. The result of this work is an approach which enables us to describe the entire state space using only 0.5% of the models, along with a series of lessons learnt. The techniques that we describe are not only applicable to oil and gas exploration, but also more generally to the HPC community as we are forced to work with reduced data-sets due to the rapid increase in data collection capability."

      "description": "Gene Expression Matrices (GEMs) are a fundamental data type in the genomics domain. As the size and scope of genomics experiments increase, researchers are struggling to process large GEMs through downstream workflows with currently accepted practices. In this paper, we propose a methodology to reduce the size of GEMs using multiple approaches.  Our method partitions data into discrete fields based on data type and employs state-of-the-art lossless and lossy compression algorithms to reduce the input data size. This work explores a variety of lossless and lossy compression methods to determine which methods work the best for each component of a GEM.  We evaluate the accuracy of the compressed GEMs by running them through the Knowledge Independent Network Construction (KINC) workflow and comparing the quality of the resulting gene co-expression network with a lossless control to verify result fidelity.  Results show that utilizing a combination of lossy and lossless compression results in compression ratios up to 9.77\u00d7 on a Yeast GEM, while still preserving the biological integrity of the data.  Usage of the compression methodology on the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia(CCLE) GEM resulted in compression ratios up to 9.26\u00d7. By using this methodology, researchers in the Genomics domain may be able to process previously inaccessible GEMs while realizing significant reduction in computational costs."

      "description": "Though considerable progress has been made on integrating parallel and distributed computing into Computer Science curricula, many challenges still remain especially earlier in the undergraduate curriculum and later in continuing education for computing professionals.  The first part of this talk will summarize experiences with HPC education in a sophomore-level course titled \"Fundamentals of Parallel Programming\" (COMP 322) introduced at Rice University in 2011.  The learning outcomes for COMP 322 fall into three course modules -- Parallelism, Concurrency, and Distribution.  We will also present experiences with a Coursera specialization that was introduced in 2017 based on COMP 322 material, but adapted into a continuing education format for computing professionals.  This specialization consists of three courses, derived from the three modules in COMP 322.<br><br>In the second part of the talk, we will summarize future computing trends as we approach the end of Moore's Law, and identify pedagogic concepts that will be relevant for the post-Moore era.  These \"extreme heterogeneity\" disruptions include new kinds of heterogenous processors and accelerators, heterogeneous memories, near/in-memory computation structures, and even non von Neumann computing elements.  In our opinion, selected concepts from current pedagogy can provide a valuable starting point for creating new pedagogical materials for the post-Moore era.  These concepts include task parallelism, data flow execution, and locality/distribution control as first-class primitives, which can enable strong semantic guarantees, as well as a promising foundation for post-Moore systems and also modern heterogeneous processors including CPUs, GPUs, DSPs, FPGAs, and NMPs."

      "description": "Teaching topics related to high performance computing and parallel and distributed computing in a hands-on manner is challenging, especially at introductory, undergraduate levels. There is a participation challenge due to the need to secure access to a platform on which students can learn via hands-on activities, which is not always possible. There are also pedagogic challenges. For instance, any particular platform provided to students imposes constraints on which learning objectives can be achieved. These challenges become steeper as the topics being taught target more heterogeneous, more distributed, and/or larger platforms, as needed to prepare students for using and developing cyberinfrastructure.<br><br>To address the above challenges, we have developed a set of pedagogic activities that can be integrated piecemeal in university courses, starting at freshman levels. These activities use simulation so that students can experience hands-on any relevant application and platform scenarios. This is achieved by capitalizing on the capabilities of the WRENCH and SimGrid simulation frameworks. After describing our approach and the pedagogic activities currently available, we present results from an evaluation performed in an undergraduate university course."

      "description": "Heterogeneous architectures have emerged as a dominant platform, not only in high performance computing but also in mobile processing, cloud computing, and the Internet of Things (IoTs). Because the curriculum is over-crowded in its current state, it is difficult to include a new course as a required part of the curriculum without increasing the number of hours to graduation. Integration of heterogeneous computing content requires a module-based approach, such as those undertaken for introducing parallel and distributed computing<br><br>In this paper, we present a teaching module that introduces CS1 students to some of the fundamental concepts in heterogeneous computing. The goal of this module is not teach students how to program heterogeneous systems but rather expose them to this emerging trend and prepare them for material they are expected to see in future classes. Although concepts are covered at a high-level, the module emphasizes active learning and includes a lab assignment that provides students hands-on experience with respect to task mapping and performance evaluation of a heterogeneous system. The module was implemented at our home institution in Fall 2018. Initial evaluation results are quite encouraging both in terms of learning outcomes and student engagement and interest."

      "description": "Due to the pervasive presence of parallel and distributed computing (PDC) in most of the application domains, the need for PDC skills in computing professionals is necessary. This has inspired much interest in including PDC topics in existing computer science (CS) undergraduate curriculum, as evidenced in the ACM/IEEE joint curriculum recommendations. We address this gap by developing new active learning style PDC activities. The application and evaluation of the unplugged activities are described in this paper. The activities highlight key benefits of parallel computing, and the appropriate application of important PDC concepts. An assessment of student engagement has been utilized to measure the effectiveness of our active learning PDC modules. We determine whether the engagement differs by gender, age, and class standing (freshman, sophomore, junior, senior). Results indicated there were slight differences with respect to age and class standing. This research contributes to helping other practitioners in the CS community by providing PDC lesson modules to be integrated into their existing courses. The developed activities and the related lesson plans are intended to provide easier learning of the fundamental PDC concepts in an early undergraduate CS curriculum."

      "description": "Much work has been done in the area of real-time algorithm visualization, in which a program produces a graphical representation of its behavior as it executes. In this lightning talk, we examine the relatively uncharted territory of real-time audialization, in which a program produces a sonic representation of its behavior as it executes. Such work seems apt to be beneficial for auditory learners, especially those with visual disabilities. To support this exploration, we have created the Thread Safe Audio Library (TSAL), a platform-independent, object-oriented C++ library that provides thread-safe classes for mixing, synthesizing, and playing sounds. Using TSAL, we can create an audialization by taking a working program and adding library calls that generate behavior-representing sounds in real time. If a program is multithreaded, each thread can play distinct sounds, allowing us to hear the multithreaded behavior. This lightning talk provides an overview of TSAL and demonstrates several audializations, including the Producers-Consumers Problem, Parallel MergeSort, and others."

One field in which high-performance computing is particularly important is computational physics. Many physicists depend on high-performance hardware and software to carry out their research. This project describes an open-source, Jupyter notebook-based web app which helps students both develop skills relating to and appreciation for HPC techniques and builds understanding of complex physical models in the domain of thermodynamics/quantum field theory.  This project is designed to help students understand, appreciate, and build skills relating to simulations of statistical systems, which are too complex to describe analytically and instead need to be described by complex monte-carlo simulations."

      "description": "In 2012, the Harvard Business Review termed data science \"The Sexiest Job of the 21st century.\"   Since that time, with the rise of GPU computation and the concurrent rise deep learning, \"data science\" skills are sought after more than ever. In early 2019, job postings for data science on Indeed.com have increased by 256% since December 2013.  As such, many academic disciplines are searching for ways of integrating data science techniques into their programs. As many data science techniques are computationally intensive, it is natural to pair data science training with training in proper use of HPC resources. At UAB, Research Computing has initiated a weekly Data Science Journal club. By training members in data science, we naturally touch on HPC topics as well, making this an ideal frontier for HPC education. Similarly to traditional academic journal clubs, new topics are discussed each week; however, rather than reading papers, the club focuses on working through practical data science applications with published code."

      "description": "The widespread presence of multicore and general-purpose graphics processing units (GPUs) in PCs, laptops, and now even handhelds has changed the computing landscape and empowered users to make valued, innovative contributions to the technology of computing. However, the current undergraduate Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) curriculum of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) at the introductory level has not yet adequately addressed the needs for this rapid change in computing hardware platforms, devices, languages, and supporting programming environments. Recognizing this urgency, the principal goal of our EXCEED project is to expose our freshmen and sophomore students to the concepts of parallel and distributed computing (PDC) by integrating modules of PDC topics in the existing curriculum. The main focus is to allow our students to develop parallel computational thinking while they learn the core topics on von-Neumann-model-based sequential computational techniques."

The main problems solved by HPC are related to computational sciences and affect almost all scientific disciplines. Training the students that will have sufficient knowledge in HPC is a crucial task of computer science departments in all educational institutions. This paper describes the steps taken to increase the undergraduate engagement in HPC disciplines in our undergraduate institution. The increased exposure allowed our computer science students to collaborate with other departments research projects by accelerating different computational intensive problems. In order to increase students knowledge in HPC we decided to offer classes at the undergraduate level in parallel programming and distributed systems; and to properly support these classes we invested in a lab specifically designed for parallel programming, with machines equipped with the best multicores cpus and gpus so students can experience the effects of massively parallel architectures in their code. <br><br>Using detailed enrollment, master thesis and publications from the last few years, since the last has been available; we can see a substantial increase in undergraduate students interest in the HPC area, and a great success in the number of research master thesis as well as the number of peer reviewed undergraduate and graduate student-authored publications."

Projects include The Data Mine, an undergraduate community of learning communities from many disciplines united by an interest in data science; disciplinary credit courses in digital humanities, microbiome analysis, and GIS; and modular courses and workshops on data science skills. These activities have created a need for innovative instructional material to support and disseminate these projects.<br><br>Our project was funded to create a Data Science Education Ecosystem Resource Collection (DSEERC) leveraging the expertise of faculty in the Purdue University Libraries and School of Information Studies (PULSIS), the expertise and infrastructure of Research Computing, and the students and instructors of The Data Mine. The scope of the collection will be curated instructional material produced by and for DSEE efforts on campus. Formats will include interactive tutorials, videos, lessons and datasets with an emphasis on modular content that can be used in courses or as needed by students. The DSEERC will lower the barrier to data science education because learners will have access to material even if they are not currently enrolled in class. Instructors can use the resource to explore new ways of teaching data science, minimize duplication of effort by reusing resources, and to grasp the DSEE landscape. This resource is critical for Purdue if we hope to build data literacy and fluency for all learners and to promote best practices in data science education."

The course targets graduate students of different research interests in Computer Science. The course aims at giving a breadth knowledge on cutting-edge well-known systems in production, and exploring the potential synergies across different areas of research. Having its roots in Distributed Computing, SSP addresses those systems that overlap with other research areas like Computational Systems, Parallel Computing, Databases, Cloud Computing, Artificial Intelligence, Security, etc. SSP exhibits an agile topic selection model that fits several students\u2019 backgrounds in each academic year. The topics focus on the practical aspects of each selected system that is considered \u201csuccessful\u201d, i.e., based on its worldwide impact and technical significance. This is important for graduate students to acquire best practices in industry and academia, necessary to build practical computing systems. In the same vein, the assessment method includes a project that is based on one of the presented systems and also intersects with the student\u2019s own research plan. Based on our teaching experience and the excellent feedback of the students, we strongly recommend this graduate course to be taught at other universities."

This approach focuses on discussion to drive student engagement whilst fostering a deeper understanding of the presented topics compared to more traditional displays of crude facts. The course is split into three sections: local concurrency, networked concurrency, and concurrency in hardware. This allows for an easier student journey through the course, as they are introduced to all core concepts in the first section, then have them reinforced in greater detail in the subsequent sections. Finally, the experience gained in updating this course is presented so others attempting to do similar may learn from it."

      "description": "The demand for computational power is rising rapidly in science and engineering and is now expanding into areas from the social sciences and humanities. This is met with the use of large-scale, and increasingly complex, High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems. Programming such heterogeneous and quickly evolving systems efficiently has always been challenging, particularly for novice HPC programmers, but is continually increasing in complexity. HPC service providers are therefore growing their training offerings as part of their overall service provision. However, there is no standard for understanding the impact and effectiveness of this training. Traditional training and education metrics, such as examination, are typically not applicable. Additionally, the key criteria for service providers are not only knowledge gained but the impact that the knowledge has on HPC usage. To capture and evaluate the effectiveness of training, a novel methodology with two key components is proposed: progress productivity and training productivity. The methodology includes a process for deriving an activity-specific weighted selection of the metrics that comprise the productivity measures. The proposed productivity criteria could then be applied to improve the training of HPC application programmers taking the participant's pre-knowledge and focus areas into account."

      "description": "Competitive gamification has been successfully used to improve the learning experience in computer science courses. Assignments based on high-performance and parallel programming contests have been shown to be highly effective to promote the interest and involvement of students. Nevertheless, during programming-contest assignments the competitive approach sometimes diminishes the usual collaboration between students to solve basic questions and common difficulties; for example, those related to the usage of the programming languages or tools. In this paper, we present an approach to integrate collaborative gamification techniques with the competitive elements of programming contests, in order to balance both aspects and to enhance the overall learning experience. The results show that this approach effectively promotes participation and collaborative behavior during a programming contest. They also reveal potential improvements that can be considered for this approach."

For this assignment students are required to read, process and answer queries using a large dataset that does not fit in the RAM memory of a commodity laptop. Using the Python framework Dask, which extends a small set of Pandas's operations, students can become familiar with parallel and distributed processing. In addition, the assignment teaches students about the basics operations implemented in Dask in a very interesting and applied way, as well as operations and algorithms that are harder to parallelize."

It targets concepts of shared-memory programming with OpenMP, distributed-memory programming with MPI, and/or GPU programming with CUDA or OpenCL. This assignment is based on a simplified agent-based simulation where teams of firefighters aim to extinguish a set of fire focal points in a dynamically evolving scenario. The program is designed to be simple, easy to understand by students, and to include specific parallelization and optimization opportunities. Although there is a quite direct parallel solution in the three programming models, the program has plenty of opportunities for further improvements. It extends the ideas of a previously presented assignment, in order to use more interesting data structures, load balancing techniques, and code optimizations. It has been successfully used in parallel programming contests during a real course, using the performance obtained by the students\u2019 code as a measure of success."

Data science curriculum (e.g. for new degree programs and within data science centers) and topics related to Internet of Things are also in the workshop scope. PDC, HPC, and data science now permeate the world of computing to a degree that makes it imperative for even entry level computer professionals to incorporate these computing modalities into their computing toolboxes, no matter what type of computing problems they work on. This workshop focuses on the state of the art in HPC and PDC education via contributed and invited papers from academia, industry, government laboratories and other educational and research institutions.<br><br>Topics of interest include all topics pertaining to the teaching of PDC and HPC within Computer Science and Engineering, Computational Science, and Domain Science and Engineering curricula. The emphasis of the workshop is undergraduate education, but fundamental issues related to graduate education are also welcome. The target audience will broadly include SC19 attendees from academia, industry, and research laboratories. This includes both researchers and educators, as well as the early adopters of the NSF/TCPP curriculum guidelines on teaching PDC (http://www.cs.gsu.edu/~tcpp/curriculum/index.php). The workshop is coordinated by the NSF-supported Center for Parallel and Distributed Computing Curriculum Development and Educational Resources (CDER). EduHPC has been an SC workshop since 2013 with attendance of 75 in both 2016 and 2017 and 70 in 2018.<br><br><a href=\"https://tcpp.cs.gsu.edu/curriculum/?q=eduhpc19\" target=\"_blank\">https://tcpp.cs.gsu.edu/curriculum/?q=eduhpc19</a>"

      "description": "As the modern hardware landscape continues to drastically change, the degree of parallelism required to maintain a high occupancy of resources has substantially increased. These hardware changes have highlighted the limitations of the traditional method of using one process per processing unit, which indicates that a more flexible programming paradigm is necessary. In the context of the message passing paradigm, MPI needs a significant improvement in threaded performance in order to fully utilize all hardware capabilities. However, for developers to know what needs to be improved, and for users to know what performance to expect, benchmarks are needed to quickly assess the capabilities and performance of MPI implementations. This paper introduces a new communication benchmark designed to replicate typical application communication patterns and assess their performance with a varied amount of resources. We evaluate three MPI implementations with our benchmark suite and assess their strengths and weaknesses."

In this paper we analyze the limitations of collective MPI communication for the computation of fast Fourier transforms (FFTs), which are relied on heavily for large-scale particle simulations. We present experiments made at one of the largest heterogeneous platforms, the Summit supercomputer at ORNL. We discuss communication models from state-of-the-art FFT libraries, and propose a new FFT library, named HEFFTE (Highly Efficient FFTs for Exascale), which supports heterogeneous architectures and yields considerable speedups compared with CPU libraries, while maintaining good weak as well as strong scalability."

      "description": "The MPI_Allreduce collective operation is a core kernel of many parallel codebases, particularly for reductions over a single value per process.  The commonly used allreduce recursive-doubling algorithm obtains the lower bound message count, yielding optimality for small reduction sizes based on node-agnostic performance models.  However, this algorithm yields duplicate messages between sets of nodes.  Node-aware optimizations in MPICH remove duplicate messages through use of a single master process per node, yielding a large number of inactive processes at each inter-node step.  In this paper, we present an algorithm that uses the multiple processes available per node to reduce the maximum number of inter-node messages communicated by a single process, improving the performance of allreduce operations, particularly for small message sizes."

MPI has been shown to be a viable option to develop a scalable PGAS communication subsystem and has the advantages of its standardization and higher performance. We used MPI two-sided semantics with a combination of automatic and user defined splitting of MPI communicators to achieve asynchronous progress. Our implementation can make use of multiple asynchronous progress ranks (PR) per node that can be mapped to the computing architecture of a node in a distributed cluster. We are able to show significant speed up of over 2.0X and scaling of a communication bound computational chemistry application distributed over 1024 nodes of state-of-the-art HPC clusters. Our results show that while running a communication bound application workload on a certain number of cluster nodes, an optimum number of ranks dedicated for communication can be found to achieve asynchronous communication progress and obtain highest performance."

Open UCX is an RDMA-based point-ot-point communication library, that can reduce the latency between processes in MPI applications, particularly in large-scale system. This paper presents a design and implementation of a library for MPI collective operations, by extending Open UCX. Our approach is transparent to MPI applications, and can reduce the latency of repeated calls to such operations by an average of 8% for relatively small message sizes and as much as 90% for larger messages."

      "description": "Distributed asynchronous programming systems require a scalable, low-latency way to exchange information on the state of units of execution (tasks) across process boundaries. These interactions can be modeled as active messages, i.e., a message that, upon reception, triggers an action on the receiving side. Such actions, generally of short duration, include the posting of the reception for a task input data or the transition of a task into the runnable state. Traditionally, such messages have been implemented using MPI two-sided communication primitives. However, processing reception queues for numerous small messages may incur significant overheads in the progress of the MPI library, notably when handling unexpected messages and iterating over a number of pre-posted requests. In this work, we investigate a different approach for implementing an active message queue using MPI-3 RMA primitives and compare the resulting performance in a task runtime in terms of scalable performance and latency against two-sided implementations. We discuss the latency of basic RMA operations and the resulting performance in terms of latency and scalable throughput of the RMA-based queues. Using a benchmark application, we show that using RMA-based queues may provide notable benefits compared to using MPI two-sided communication for inter-scheduler<br>communication."

      "description": "Understanding program behavior is critical to overcome the expected architectural and programming complexities, such as limited power budgets, heterogeneity, hierarchical memories, shrinking I/O bandwidths, and performance variability, that arise on modern HPC platforms. To do so, HPC software developers need intuitive support tools for debugging, performance measurement, analysis, and tuning of large-scale HPC applications. Moreover, data collected from these tools such as hardware counters, communication traces, and network traffic can be far too large and too complex to be analyzed in a straightforward manner. We need new automatic analysis and visualization approaches to help application developers intuitively understand the multiple, interdependent effects that algorithmic choices have on application correctness or performance. The Workshop on Programming and Performance Visualization Tools (ProTools) intends to bring together HPC application developers, tool developers, and researchers from the visualization, performance, and program analysis fields for an exchange of new approaches to assist developers in analyzing, understanding, and optimizing programs for extreme-scale platforms.<br><br>Covering all aspects of HPC program and performance analysis - data collection, visualization, and tools - the ProTools workshop intends to attract a broad set of research communities, and facilitate better interactions between these communities. The Virtual Institute - High Productivity Supercomputing (VI-HPS) will provide support for the ProTools workshop. VI-HPS is an international initiative of HPC researchers and developers focused on programming and performance tools for parallel systems."

      "description": "Using a CPU-GPU hybrid computing framework is becoming a common configuration for supercomputers. The wide deployment of GPUs (as well as other hardware accelerators) brings to the HPC community a big question: Are we using them effectively? Inappropriate use of GPUs can generate incorrect results in certain cases, but more often, will slow down the program instead of speeding it up. This paper describes a tool that satisfies the needs of programmers to analyze the runtime performance of kernels and obtain insights for better GPU utilization. Compared to existing GPU performance tools, ours provides some unique features: data-centric profiling and generating complete GPU call stacks. With the guidance of the tool, we were able to improve the kernel performance of three widely-studied GPU benchmarks by a factor of up to 46.6x with minor code modification."

Already during system design, performance models can help ponder alternatives. However, creating a performance model - whether theoretically or empirically - for an entire application that does not exist yet is challenging unless the interactions between all system components are well understood, which is often not the case during design.  In this paper, we propose to generate performance models of full programs from performance models of their components using formal composition operators derived from parallel design patterns such as pipeline or task pool. As long as the design of the overall system follows such a pattern, its performance model can be predicted with reasonable accuracy without an actual implementation."

      "description": "This paper highlights the necessary development of new instrumentation tools within the PaRSE task-based runtime system to leverage the performance of low-rank matrix computations. In particular, the tile low-rank (TLR) Cholesky factorization represents one of the most critical matrix operations toward solving challenging large-scale scientific applications. The challenge resides in the heterogeneous arithmetic intensity of the various computational kernels, which stresses PaRSE's dynamic engine when orchestrating the task executions at runtime. Such irregular workload imposes the deployment of new scheduling heuristics to privilege the critical path, while exposing task parallelism to maximize hardware occupancy. To measure the effectiveness of PaRSE's engine and its various scheduling strategies for tackling such workloads, it becomes paramount to implement adequate performance analysis and profiling tools tailored to fine-grained and heterogeneous task execution. This permits us not only to provide insights from PaRSE, but also to identify potential applications' performance bottlenecks. These instrumentation tools may actually foster synergism between applications and PaRSE developers for productivity as well as high-performance computing purposes. We demonstrate the benefits of these amenable tools, while assessing the performance of TLR Cholesky factorization from data distribution, communication-reducing and synchronization-reducing perspectives. This tool-assisted performance analysis results in three major contributions: a new hybrid data distribution, a new hierarchical TLR Cholesky algorithm, and a new performance model for tuning the tile size. The new TLR Cholesky factorization achieves an 8X performance speedup over existing implementations on massively parallel supercomputers, toward solving large-scale 3D climate and weather prediction applications."

      "description": "The analysis of runtime  performance is important during the development and throughout the life cycle of HPC applications.  One important objective in  performance analysis is to identify regions in the code that show significant runtime increase with larger problem sizes or more processes.  One approach to identify such regions is to use empirical performance modeling,  i.e.,  building  performance  models  based  on  measurements.  While  the  modeling  itself  has  already  been  streamlined and  automated,  the  generation  of  the  required  measurements is  time  consuming  and  tedious.  In  this  paper,  we  propose  an approach  to  automatically  adjust  the  instrumentation  to  reduce overhead  and  focus  the  measurements  to  relevant  regions,  i.e.,such that show increasing runtime with larger input parameters or  increasing  number  of  MPI  ranks.  Our  approach  employs Extra-P  to  generate  performance  models,  which  it  then  uses to   extrapolate   runtime   and,   finally,   decide   which   functions should  be  kept  for  measurement.  Also,  the  analysis  expands the  instrumentation,  by  heuristically  adding  functions  based  on static  source-code  features.  We  evaluate  our  approach  using benchmarks  from  SPEC  CPU  2006,  SU2,  and  parallel  MILC. The  evaluation  shows  that  our  approach  can  filter  functions  of little  interest  and  generate  profiles  that  contain  mostly  relevant regions.  For  example,  the  overhead  for  SU2  can  be  improved automatically  from 200% to 11% compared  to  filtered  Score-P measurements."

Kokkos provides a performance portable API for expressing parallelism at the node level. TAU uses the Kokkos profiling system to expose performance factors using user-specified parallel kernel names for lambda functions or C++ functors. It can also use instrumentation at the OpenMP, CUDA, pthread, or other runtime levels to expose the implementation details giving a dual focus of higher-level abstractions as well as low-level execution dynamics.

      "description": "Performance analysis and optimization are essential tasks for hardware and software engineers.  In the age of datacenter-scale computing, it is particularly important to conduct comparative performance analysis to understand discrepancies and limitations among different hardware systems and applications.<br>However, there is a distinct lack of productive visualization tools for these comparisons.<br><br>We present CHAMPVis, a web-based, interactive visualization tool that leverages the hierarchical organization of hardware systems to enable productive performance analysis.  With CHAMPVis, users can make definitive performance comparisons across applications or hardware platforms.  In addition, CHAMPVis provides methods to rank and cluster based on performance metrics to identify common optimization opportunities.  Our thorough task analysis reveals three types of datacenter-scale performance analysis tasks: summarization, detailed comparative analysis, and interactive performance bottleneck identification.  We propose techniques for each class of tasks including (1) 1-D feature space projection for similarity analysis; (2) Hierarchical parallel co-ordinates for comparative analysis; and (3) User interactions for rapid diagnostic queries to identify optimization targets.  We evaluate CHAMPVis by analyzing standard datacenter applications and machine learning benchmarks in two different case studies."

      "description": "As application scientists develop and deploy simula- tion codes on to leadership-class computing resources, there is a need to instrument these codes to better understand performance to efficiently utilize these resources. This instrumentation may come from independent third-party tools that generate and store performance metrics or from custom instrumentation tools built directly into the application. The metrics collected are then available for visual analysis, typically in the domain in which there were collected. In this paper, we introduce an approach to visualize and analyze the performance metrics in situ in the context of the machine, application, and communication domains (MAC model) using a single visualization tool. This visualization model provides a holistic view of the application performance in the context of the resources where it is executing."

      "description": "Understanding the performance characteristics of applications in modern HPC environments is becoming more challenging due to the increase in the architectural and programming complexities. HPC software developers rely on sources such as hardware counters and event traces to infer performance problems while focusing on designing mitigation strategies. A large number of in-house tools exist in the community, which indicate replicated effort. This paper presents a customizable framework for analyzing performance measurements and visualizing through a web-based interactive dashboard for interactively exploring a large volume of hierarchical information. In this paper, we analyze three ECP applications as use cases and identify as well as optimize problematic resource utilization behaviors exposed by our visualizations.  This framework is a step towards a unified platform for visual identification of performance scaling bottlenecks to ease the collaboration between application developers, performance analysts, and hardware vendors."

      "description": "Understanding program behavior is critical to overcome the expected architectural and programming complexities, such as limited power budgets, heterogeneity, hierarchical memories, shrinking I/O bandwidths, and performance variability, that arise on modern HPC platforms. To do so, HPC software developers need intuitive support tools for debugging, performance measurement, analysis, and tuning of large-scale HPC applications. Moreover, data collected from these tools such as hardware counters, communication traces, and network traffic can be far too large and too complex to be analyzed in a straightforward manner. We need new automatic analysis and visualization approaches to help application developers intuitively understand the multiple, interdependent effects that algorithmic choices have on application correctness or performance. The Workshop on Programming and Performance Visualization Tools (ProTools) intends to bring together HPC application developers, tool developers, and researchers from the visualization, performance, and program analysis fields for an exchange of new approaches to assist developers in analyzing, understanding, and optimizing programs for extreme-scale platforms.<br><br>Covering all aspects of HPC program and performance analysis - data collection, visualization, and tools - the ProTools workshop intends to attract a broad set of research communities, and facilitate better interactions between these communities. The Virtual Institute - High Productivity Supercomputing (VI-HPS) will provide support for the ProTools workshop.

      "description": "Energy efficiency has become a first class citizen in the design of large computing systems. While GPUs and custom processors have shown merit in this regard, reconfigurable architectures, such as FPGAs, promise another major step in energy efficiency, constituting a middle ground between fixed hardware architectures and custom-built ASICs. Programming FPGAs has traditionally been done in hardware description languages, requiring extensive hardware knowledge and significant engineering effort. This tutorial shows how high-level synthesis (HLS) can be harnessed to productively achieve scalable pipeline parallelism on FPGAs. Attendees will learn how to target FPGA resources from high-level C++ or OpenCL code, guiding the mapping from imperative code to hardware, enabling them to develop massively parallel designs with real performance benefits. We treat well-known examples from the software world, relating traditional code optimizations to both corresponding and new transformations for hardware, building on existing knowledge when introducing new topics. By bridging the gap between software and hardware optimization, our tutorial aims to enable developers from a larger set of backgrounds to start tapping into the potential of FPGAs with real high performance codes."

      "description": "This tutorial is a practical guide on how to run distributed deep learning over multiple compute nodes effectively. Deep Learning (DL) has emerged as an effective analysis method and has adapted quickly across many scientific domains in recent years.  Domain scientists are embracing DL as both a standalone data science method and an effective approach to reducing dimensionality in the traditional simulation. However, due to its inherent high computational requirement, application of DL is limited by the available computational resources. Recently, we have seen the fusion of DL and high-performance computing (HPC): supercomputers show an unparalleled capacity to reduce DL training time from days to minutes; HPC techniques have been used to speed up parallel DL training. Therefore, distributed deep learning has great potential to augment DL applications by leveraging existing high performance computing cluster. <br><br>This tutorial consists of three sessions. First, we will give an overview of the state-of-art approaches to enabling deep learning at scale. The second session is an interactive hands-on session to help attendees running distributed deep learning on Frontera at the Texas Advanced Computing Center. In the last session, we will focus on the best practices on how to scale, evaluate, and tune up performance."

Not just responding to disasters, but also using HPC to make urgent decisions addressing more general issues, such as human health emergencies and global diseases, requires expertise in a wide range of areas. From dealing with real-time data, to experience in generating results within specific time frames (real-time constraints), and generating visualizations enabling front-line decision makers to make correct choices first time, every time. The challenges here are significant, but if HPC can be proven as a tool in responding to these real-world issues, the impact for our community is huge.<br><br>This workshop will bring together stakeholders, researchers and practitioners from across the HPC community to identify and tackle issues involved in using HPC for urgent decision making. Success stories, case-studies and challenges will be shared, with the goal of further building up a community around leveraging HPC as an important tool in urgently responding to disasters and societal challenges."

Based on a recently published progressive algorithm for the clustering of persistence diagrams, we determine the optimal number of clusters, and therefore the number of significantly different outcome scenarios, by the minimization of established statistical score functions. Furthermore, we present a proof-of-concept prototype implementation of the statistical selection of the number of clusters and provide the results of an experimental study, where this implementation has been applied to real-world ensemble data sets."

Our approach provides a solution to an urgent need for disaster management using massive data processing and high performance computing. The traffic data used in this demonstration is collected from the public camera systems on Interstate highways in the Southeast United States. Our solution launches a parallel processing system that is the size of a Top 5 supercomputer using the Google Cloud Platform. Results show that the parallel processing system can be launched in a few hours, that it is effective at fast processing of high volume data, and can be de-provisioned in a few hours.  We processed 211TB of video utilizing 6,227,593 core hours over the span of about eight hours with an average cost of around $0.008 per vCPU hour, which is less than the cost of many on-premise HPC systems."

      "description": "The use of High Performance Computing (HPC) to compliment urgent decision making in the event of disasters is an important future potential use of supercomputers. However, the usage modes involved are rather different from how HPC has been used traditionally. As such, there are many obstacles that need to be overcome, not least the unbounded wait times in the batch system queues, to make the use of HPC in disaster response practical. In this paper, we present how the VESTEC project plans to overcome these issues and develop a working prototype of an urgent computing control system. We describe the requirements for such a system and analyse the different technologies available that can be leveraged to successfully build such a system. We finally explore the design of the VESTEC system and discuss ongoing challenges that need to be addressed to realise a production level system."

      "description": "Tsunamis pose a hazard that may strike a coastal population within a short amount of time. To effectively forecast and warn for tsunamis, extremely fast simulations are needed. However, until recently such urgent tsunami simulations have been infeasible in the context of early warning and even for high-resolution rapid post-event assessment. The implementation of efficient tsunami numerical codes using Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) has now allowed much faster simulations, which have opened a new avenue for carrying out simulations Faster Than Real Time (FTRT). This paper discusses the need for urgent computing in computational tsunami science, and presents workflows for two applications, namely FTRT itself and Probabilistic Tsunami Forecasting (PTF). PTF relies on a very high number of FTRT simulations addressing forecasting uncertainty, whose full quantification will be made more and more at reach with the advent of exascale computing resources."

      "description": "Matrix factorizations and the accompanying solution algorithms (e.g., triangular solution associated with the LU factorization) are often the most robust algorithmic choices for linear systems from multi-physics and multi-scale simulations. They are indispensable tools for building various algebraic equation solvers. They can be used as direct solvers, as coarse-grid solvers in multigrid, or as preconditioners for iterative solvers. As we are approaching the exascale computing era, demand for algorithm innovation is increasingly high. It is imperative to develop optimal-complexity scalable algorithms both in flop count and more importantly in data movement, such as, in the form of communication-avoiding formulations, and low-rank and butterfly compressions. On the software and implementation side, it is imperative to exploit multiple levels of parallelism presented by the heterogeneous node architectures through well orchestrated use of MPI, OpenMP and GPU programming like CUDA. <br><br>In this tutorial, we will present our recently developed novel techniques to address scalability gaps. We will demonstrate their efficacies through three solver libraries: SuperLU, STRUMPACK and ButterflyPACK, with representative use cases from simulations and data analytics. Through hands-on exercises, the participants will learn how to use each solver most effectively for their target problems and parallel machines."

At the same time, the MPI standard itself is evolving to address the needs and challenges of future extreme-scale platforms as well as applications. This tutorial will cover several advanced features of MPI, including new MPI-3 features, that can help users program modern systems effectively. Using code examples based on scenarios found in real applications, we will cover several topics including efficient ways of doing 2D and 3D stencil computation, derived datatypes, one- sided communication, hybrid (MPI + shared memory) programming, topologies and topology mapping, and neighborhood and nonblocking collectives. Attendees will leave the tutorial with an understanding of how to use these advanced features of MPI and guidelines on how they might perform on different platforms and architectures."

      "description": "With the increasing prevalence of multicore processors, shared-memory programming models are essential. OpenMP is a popular, portable, widely supported, and easy-to-use shared-memory model. Developers usually find OpenMP easy to learn. However, they are often disappointed with the performance and scalability of the resulting code. This disappointment stems not from shortcomings of OpenMP but rather with the lack of depth with which it is employed. Our \u201cAdvanced OpenMP Programming\u201d tutorial addresses this critical need by exploring the implications of possible OpenMP parallelization strategies, both in terms of correctness and performance.<br><br>We assume attendees understand basic parallelization concepts and know the fundamentals of OpenMP. We focus on performance aspects, such as data and thread locality on NUMA architectures, false sharing, and exploitation of vector units. All topics are accompanied with extensive case studies and we discuss the corresponding language features in-depth. Based on the feedback from previous years, we have taken out the part on directives for attached compute accelerators, to focus solely on performance programming for multi-core architectures. Throughout all topics, we present the recent additions of OpenMP 5.0."

Computer architecture changes require new software design and implementation strategies, including significant refactoring of existing code. Reproducibility demands require more rigor across the entire software endeavor. Code coupling requires aggregate team interactions including integration of software processes and practices.  These challenges demand large investments in scientific software development and improved practices.  Focusing on improved developer productivity and software sustainability is both urgent and essential.<br><br>This tutorial will provide information and hands-on experience with software practices, processes, and tools explicitly tailored for CSE.  Goals are improving the productivity of those who develop CSE software and increasing the sustainability of software artifacts.  We discuss practices that are relevant for projects of all sizes, with emphasis on small teams, and on aggregate teams composed of small teams.  Topics include software licensing, effective models, tools, and processes for small teams (including agile workflow management), reproducibility, and scientific software testing (including automated testing and continuous integration)."

This tutorial provides a comprehensive survey of fault-tolerant techniques for high-performance and big data applications, with a fair balance between theory and practice. This tutorial is organized along four main topics:<br> <br>(i) An overview of failure types (software/hardware, transient/fail-stop), and typical probability distributions (Exponential, Weibull, Log-Normal);<br><br>(ii) General-purpose techniques, which include several checkpoint and rollback recovery protocols, replication, prediction, silent error detection and correction;<br><br>(iii) Application-specific techniques, such as user-level in-memory checkpointing, data replication (map-reduce) or fixed-point convergence for iterative applications (backpropagation); and<br><br>(iv) Practical deployment of fault tolerance techniques with User Level Fault Mitigation (a proposed MPI standard extension). <br><br>Relevant examples will include widely used routines such as map-reduce and backpropagation in neural networks.  A step-by-step approach will show how to protect these routines and make them fault-tolerant, using a variety of techniques, in a hands-on session.<br><br>The tutorial is open to all SC19 attendees who are interested in the current status and expected promise of fault-tolerant approaches for scientific and big data applications. There are no audience prerequisites: background will be provided for all protocols and probabilistic models.  However, basic knowledge of MPI will be helpful for the hands-on session."

Parallel performance tools from the Virtual Institute \u2013 High Productivity Supercomputing (VI-HPS) are introduced and featured in hands-on exercises with Score-P, Scalasca, Vampir, and TAU. We present the complete workflow of performance engineering, including instrumentation, measurement (profiling and tracing, timing and PAPI hardware counters), data storage, analysis, and visualization. Emphasis is placed on how tools are used in combination for identifying performance problems and investigating optimization alternatives. Using their own computers with a provided HPC Linux [http://www.hpclinux.org] OVA image containing all of the necessary tools (running within a virtual machine), participants will conduct exercises on a contemporary HPC system where remote access will be provided for the hands-on sessions. This will help to prepare participants to locate and diagnose performance bottlenecks in their own parallel programs.<br><br>The morning sessions will focus on the tools' complementary execution analysis capabilities, while the common approach to application instrumentation and measurement will be covered in the afternoon."

      "description": "As concurrency and complexity continue to increase on high-end machines, I/O performance is rapidly becoming a fundamental challenge to achieving exascale computing. Wider adoption of higher-level I/O abstractions will be critically important to address this challenge. Modern I/O libraries provide data models, portable APIs, storage abstractions, and self-describing data containers. They achieve high performance and scalability, allow data to be managed more effectively throughout the data lifecycle, and enable reproducible science. <br><br>Part I of this tutorial will provide an overview of parallel I/O systems and summarize the key techniques for obtaining high performance I/O on high-performance computing (HPC) resources at scale. Part II introduces ADIOS and HDF5 libraries, delving through their usage models and examples, showing how to achieve high performance scalable I/O. Part III explains data compression and shows how to use it with I/O libraries. Part IV covers techniques for creating in situ analytics and teaches how to generate visualization services using VTK-M. Finally, Part V will explain data indexing/querying and how to use the libraries to query data both in situ and on files. Over one half of this tutorial will be hands-on sessions, where we provide access to the software, and go through live examples."

Over time, hardware has evolved with more complex memory hierarchies forcing us to embrace NUMA machines and work to understand how OpenMP fits in with distributed memory systems.<br><br>Current trends in hardware bring co-processors such as GPUs into the fold.  A modern platform is often a heterogeneous system with CPU cores, GPU cores, and other specialized accelerators.  OpenMP has responded by adding directives that map code and data onto a device.

We assume people know the fundamentals of OpenMP (perhaps by taking the OpenMP Common Core tutorial at SC19 the day before) so we can focus on deeply understanding the target directives and their use in complex application programs. We expect students to use their own laptops (with Windows, Linux, or OS/X) to connect to remote servers with GPUs.  You may also want to load an OpenMP compiler onto their laptops before the tutorial.  Information about OpenMP compilers is available at www.openmp.org."

      "description": "Kubernetes has emerged as the leading container orchestration solution over the past few years. Developed at Google, now maintained by Cloud Native Foundation, it sports a very diverse and active development community. While initially developed for the cloud, it can also be deployed on-prem. It also supports federating several independent clusters into much larger logical resource pools, which can span multiple administrative and geographical regions.<br><br>One of Kubernetes advantages is its ability to effectively and securely co-schedule service containers alongside user containers. Service applications run with high privileges, with functionality and performance typical of bare metal deployments. User applications are given only basic privileges and limited resources, allowing for both a safe operating environment and fair resource sharing. The Kubernetes framework provides the glue to link them together allowing for a fully functional system.<br><br>In this tutorial, the attendees will learn how Kubernetes was used to create a nationwide cyber infrastructure that is serving hundreds of scientific groups through NFS-funded projects like OSG, PRP, TNRP and CHASE-CI. The program includes a Kubernetes architectural overview, hands on sessions operating on the PRP production Kubernetes cluster, and examples of how OSG and PRP are leveraging the Kubernetes cluster for facilitating scientific computing."

      "description": "HPC support teams are often tasked with installing scientific software for their user community and the complexity of managing a large software stack gets very challenging. Software installation brings forth many challenges that requires a team of domain expertise and countless hours troubleshooting to build an optimal software state that is tuned to the architecture. In the past decade, two software build tools (Easybuild, Spack) have emerged that are widely accepted in HPC community to accelerate building a complete software stack for HPC systems.  The support team are constantly involved in fulfilling software request for end-users which leads to an ever-growing software ecosystem. Once a software is installed, the support team hands it off to the user without any testing because scientific software requires domain expertise in order to test software. Some software packages are shipped with a test suite that can be run at post build while many software have no mechanism for testing. This poses a knowledge gap between HPC support team and end-users on the type of testing to do. Some HPC centers may have developed in-house test scripts that are suitable for testing their software, but these tests are not portable due to hardcoded paths and are often site dependent. In addition, there is no collaboration between HPC sites in building a test repository that will benefit the community. This paper presents buildtest, a framework to automate  testing for a software stack along with several module operations that would be of interest to HPC support teams."

      "description": "Package managers, containers, automated testing, and Continuous Integration (CI), are becoming an essential part of HPC development workflows.  These automated tools often require software recompilation.  However, large stacks such as those deployed on HPC clusters can have combinatorial dependencies, and may take a system several days to compile.  Despite the use of simple parallelization (such as 'make -j'), build execution time often do not scale with system resources.  For such cases, it is possible to improve overall installation time by compiling parts of software stack independently, each scheduled on a subset of available cores.  We apply malleable-task scheduling algorithms to better exploit available parallelism in build system workflows and improve stack build time overall.  Using a prototype implementation in the Spack package manager, malleable-task scheduling can improve build times by more than 2x."

      "description": "Regression testing of HPC systems is of crucial importance when it comes to ensure the quality of service offered to the end users. At the same time, it poses a great challenge to the systems and application engineers to continuously maintain regression tests that cover as many aspects as possible of the user experience. In this paper, we briefly present ReFrame, a framework for writing regression tests for HPC systems and how this is used by CSCS, NERSC and OSC to continuously test their systems. ReFrame is designed to abstract away the complexity of the interactions with the system and to separate the logic of a regression test from the low-level details, which pertain to the system configuration and setup. Regression tests in ReFrame are simple Python classes that specify the basic parameters of the test plus any additional logic. The framework will load the test and send it down a well-defined pipeline which will take care of its execution. ReFrame can be easily set up on any cluster and its straightforward invocation allows it to be easily integrated with common continuous integration/deployment (CI/CD) tools, in order to perform continuous testing of an HPC system. Finally, its ability to feed the collected performance data to well known log channels, such as Syslog, Graylog or, simply, parsable log files, make it also a powerful tool for continuously monitoring the health of the system from user\u2019s perspective."

Three innovative HPC user-support tools, core_usage, show_affinity, and amask, have been designed and implemented to change this status. These tools are helping HPC users and administrators easily monitor CPU usage and affinity.

These teams have many functions covering basic system administration, managing 100's of Petabytes with complex hierarchal data-storage systems, supporting high performance networks, consulting on math libraries, code optimization, and managing HPC software stacks. Often, support teams struggle to adequately support scientists. HPC environments are extremely complex, and combined with the complexity of multi-user installations, exotic hardware, and maintaining research software supporting 100's or even 1000's of HPC users can be extremely demanding.<br><br>The HUST workshop, has been the ideal forum where new and innovative tools such as XALT, SPACK, and Easybuild have been widely announced to the broader HPC community. This has created communities and special interest groups about these tools, many of which now hold their own BoFs, workshops, and tutorials at SC, ISC and other HPC conferences. HUST will continue to provide a necessary forum for system administrators, user support team members, tool developers, policy makers, and end users. We will provide a forum to discuss support issues and we will provide a publication venue for current support developments. Best practices, user support tools, and any ideas to streamline user support at supercomputing centers are in scope.<br><br><a href=\"https://hust-workshop.github.io\" target=\"_blank\"> https://hust-workshop.github.io</a>"

      "description": "Performing health data analytics at scale presents several challenges to classic HPC environments. Datasets contain personal health information (PHI) and are updated regularly, complicating data access on publicly accessible HPC systems. Moreover, the diverse group of tasks and models \u2013 ranging from neural networks for information extraction to knowledge bases for predictive modeling \u2013 have widely varying scales, hardware preferences, and software requirements. Both exascale systems and cloud-based environments have the opportunity to play important roles by addressing data security and performance portability. Cloud platforms provide out-of-the-box solutions for maintaining data security, while recent work has extended secure computing environments to systems like OLCF Summit. In this talk I will discuss how we are handling the need for scalable HPC resources with the data security requirements inherent in working with personal health information, in the context of the interagency partnership between the Department of Energy and the National Cancer Institute. As part of this partnership, we are developing state-of-the-art deep learning models to perform information extraction from cancer pathology reports for near real-time cancer incidence reporting. Our approach to addressing the patient privacy complexities involves integral roles for both traditional HPC resources and cloud-like platforms, playing to the relative strengths of both modalities."

NCI\u2019s HPC facility lies in the range 20-150 on the top500 list, depending on stage within its lifecycle. The facility also manages on the order of 70PB of high-performance data storage capacity, comprising both projectized data spaces as well as high curated, functionalized FAIR data collections of national significance. Alongside its HPC capability provisioning, NCI has run a cloud architecture for internal and selected external purposes and over the past 5 years has progressively evaluated the most effective functional role that a cloud infrastructure might play in the context of a national facility. Strategically, its current focus with cloud is to build the infrastructure for major research communities that have the demand; the national strategic priority and the resourcing capabilities to partner NCI in development of services and functionalities beyond the provision of \u201cbare metal\u201d hardware as an infrastructure. One of the significant technical challenges associated with this is the need for data analytics that access the petabyte-scale datasets residing on NCI\u2019s high performance storage file systems, necessitating a level of data transfer bandwidth and compute resourcing that are not typical of \u201cconventional\u201d cloud.  In this presentation I will give an overview of the above issues as NCI Australia encounters them presently, providing examples of current activities and sketching the future as we see it at this point."

      "description": "CERN was established in 1954, with the mission of advancing science for peace and exploring fundamental physics questions \u2014 primarily through elementary particle research. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN is the world's most powerful particle accelerator colliding bunches of protons 40 million times every second. This extremely high rate of collisions makes it possible to identify rare phenomenon and to declare new discoveries such as the Higgs boson in 2012. The high-energy physics (HEP) community has long been a driver in processing enormous scientific datasets and in managing the largest scale high-throughput computing centres. Today, the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid is a collaboration of more than 170 computing centres in 42 countries, spread across five continents. Recently demonstrations at scale of both commercial cloud providers and HPC centers have been performed.<br><br>In 2026 we will launch the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC), which will represent a true exa-scale computing challenge. The processing capacity required by the experiments is expected to be 50 to 100 times greater than today, with storage needs expected to be on the order of exabytes. Neither the rate of technology improvement nor the computing budget will increase fast enough to satisfy these needs and new sources of computing and new ways of working will be needed to fully exploit the physics potential of this challenging accelerator. The growth of commercial clouds and HPC centres into the exa-scale represents a huge opportunity to increase the potential total resource pool, but even together this ecosystem may not be sufficient to satisfy the needs of our scientific workflows. The total computing required is pushing us to investigate alternative architectures and alternative methods of processing and analysis. In this presentation we will discuss the R&D activities to utilize HPC and cloud providers. We will summarize our progress and challenges in operating on dedicated resources and on shared and purchased allocations on HPC and cloud. We will outline the biggest impedance issues to interoperating these facilities, which often have similar challenges for data handing and scale but very different challenges in flexibility and operations. We will close  by addressing forward looking projects together with industry partners to utilize techniques like Machine Learning and optimized hardware to fundamentally change how many resources are needed to extract science from the datasets."

      "description": "Computing has always been part of experimental science, and is increasingly playing a central role in enabling scientific discovery. Technological advances are providing more powerful supercomputers and super-efficient specialized chip architectures. It is also advancing instrument technology, resulting in higher resolution detectors that produce orders of magnitude more data and allow access to exciting new scientific domains. <br><br>The scale of the compute needs of such instruments is typically mixed, sometimes requiring cloud or small cluster computing and sometimes requiring dedicated access to a supercomputer. There is a vital dependence on how quickly the compute power can be available and how quickly the data can be transferred to the compute site, as many experiments require real-time data analysis. Using real-life examples from high energy physics, microscopy and genomics, I will discuss how experimental science is taking advantage of both cloud and near-exascale HPC resources. I will outline some of the challenges we see in operating such workflows across multiple sites, with a focus on system responsiveness and data management issues."

      "description": "Without a doubt cloud has reshaped the enterprise datacenter and there is an ongoing debate as to what extent this disruption will also spill into Supercomputing. Many of the concepts and capabilities that we see today in cloud were spearheaded by the Grid computing initiatives that this community introduced in the early 90s. However, the technology and economics have dramatically involved since then. Cloud is an overloaded term used to capture a wide range of characteristics including business models, technologies, operational models and user access paradigms. Although some of these considerations will be assessed based on the individual requirements of an organization, there are cloud technologies that are becoming industry standards and an integral part of the Supercomputing industry.<br><br>This presentation will focus on how leveraging cloud technologies adapted to meet the needs of Supercomputing workloads is a dominant trend that is empowering system administrators to be more productive and end users to have an experience familiar and analogous to cloud environments.<br><br>In a cloud based system management solution all capabilities are exposed to the system administrators and DevOps personnel as an open, programmable fabric that can be either integrated to a broader management ecosystem or operated separately with open source, commercial, or home-grown tools. This is the foundation for providing the necessary automation and programmability to easily expose capabilities such as policy-based self-service, multi-tenancy, and elasticity. <br><br>The cloudification of the supercomputer system management infrastructure is also a requirement for the interoperation and integration of supercomputers with public cloud environments. Although today most organizations make a binary decision to deploy their solution to a public or private cloud, it is possible that in the future hybrid cloud might become more prevalent in our industry, especially with the proliferation of processor architectures and silicon specialization.<br><br>Finally, our community has been in the forefront of researching technologies and solutions that meet the extreme requirements of our industry. The availability of an open and programable computer fabric removes any barriers to collect data and experiment."

However, a range of technical, organizational and sociological challenges must be overcome to make these interactive workflows mainstream in HPC centers: What simulation scenarios or problem domains can benefit most from interactivity? How can we simplify the toolchain? What center policies are needed to support highly interactive workflows? The goal of this workshop is to bring together domain scientists, tool developers, and HPC center administrators to identify the scientific impact and technical challenges of highly interactive access to HPC resources.<br><br><a href=\"https://sites.google.com/view/interactive-hpc/home\" target=\"_blank> https://sites.google.com/view/interactive-hpc/home</a>"

      "description": "Novel scalable scientific algorithms are needed in order to enable key science applications to exploit the computational power of large-scale systems. This is especially true for the current tier of leading petascale and machines and the road to exascale computing as HPC systems continue to scale up in compute node and processor core count. These extreme-scale systems require novel scientific algorithms to hide network and memory latency, have very high computation/communication overlap, have minimal communication, and have no synchronization points. With the advent of Big Data and AI in the past few years, the need of such scalable mathematical methods and algorithms able to handle data and compute intensive applications at scale becomes even more important. <br><br>Scientific algorithms for multi-petaflop and exaflop systems also need to be fault tolerant and fault resilient, since the probability of faults increases with scale. Resilience at the system software and at the algorithmic level is needed as a crosscutting effort. Finally, with the advent of heterogeneous compute nodes that employ standard processors as well as GPGPUs, scientific algorithms need to match these architectures to extract the most performance. This includes different system-specific levels of parallelism as well as co-scheduling of computation. Key science applications require novel mathematics and mathematical models and system software that address the scalability and resilience challenges of current- and future-generation extreme-scale HPC systems."

      "description": "Modern AI with deep learning poses significant overhead in training over very large data sets, whereby the use of HPC techniques to compute in parallel on a large machine is becoming increasingly popular. However, most of the efforts have been on GPUs at relatively low scale, in the order of a few hundreds, up to a thousand except on fairly limited sets of cases, due to inherent difficulties. On Fugaku we plan on extending the capabilities of deep learning by allowing training to be done on the full machine, or more than 100,000 nodes. This requires various technological underpinnings as well as new algorithms for scalable training, the ongoing effort whose curent state will be described."

      "description": "Iterative methods for solving large linear systems are common parts of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) codes. The Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient (P-CG) method is one of the most widely used iterative methods. However, in the P-CG method, global collective communication is a crucial bottleneck especially on accelerated computing platforms. To resolve this issue, communication avoiding (CA) variants of the P-CG method are becoming increasingly important. In this paper, the P-CG and Preconditioned Chebyshev Basis CA CG (P-CBCG) solvers in the multiphase CFD code JUPITER are ported on the latest V100 GPUs. All GPU kernels are highly optimized to achieve about 90\u00a5% of the roofline performance, the block Jacobi preconditioner is re-designed to extract high computing power of GPUs, and the remaining bottleneck of halo data communication is avoided by overlapping communication and computation. The overall performance of the P-CG and P-CBCG solvers is determined by the competition between the CA properties of the global collective communication and the halo data communication, indicating an importance of the inter-node interconnect bandwidth per GPU.<br>The developed GPU solvers are accelerated up to 2x compared with the former CPU solvers on KNLs, and excellent strong scaling is achieved up to 7,680 GPUs on the Summit."

      "description": "The Scalable Implementation of Finite Elements by NASA (ScIFEN) is a software package developed to solve complex computational materials and structures problems using the finite element method (FEM). In this paper, we describe optimization techniques to speed up the linear solver computation that occurs within the ScIFEN application. We consider GPUs from two different vendors, NVIDIA and AMD as our target platforms for optimization and highlight differences in performance and optimization techniques. The NVIDIA GPU Volta V100 is used in the Summit system deployed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and the new exascale system, Frontier,  will be using AMD Radeon Instinct GPU.  We evaluated the performance of various optimization techniques on test matrices, ranging in size from 100K to 4M, that are representative of ScIFEN applications. The linear solver computation is memory-bound on both GPUs. Our experiments show that on the NVIDIA GPU we obtained up to 79% of the theoretical peak bandwidth, while the AMD GPU achieved 59%.  Overall, the NVIDIA V100 GPU outperforms the AMD MI 25 GPU.  We observed an overall speedup of up to 37X on an NVIDIA V100 compared to an Intel Skylake 12-core machine. The solver for a 4M degree of freedom system took under 2.5 seconds."

      "description": "Low-precision computations are popular in machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) applications. Hardware architectures, such as high-end GPUs, now support native 16-bit floating point arithmetic (i.e. half-precision). While  half-precision provides a natural 2x/4x speedups against the performance of single/double precisions, modern GPUs are equipped with hardware accelerators for even more FP16 performance. These accelerators, which are called tensor cores, have a theoretical peak performance that is 8x/16x faster than FP32/FP64 performance, respectively. Such a high level of performance has encouraged researchers to harness the compute power of the tensor cores outside AI applications. <br><br>This paper presents a mixed-precision dense linear solver (Ax = b) for complex matrices using the tensor core units of the GPU. Unlike similar efforts that have discussed accelerating Ax=b using real FP16 arithmetic, this paper focuses on complex precisions. The developed solution uses a ``half-complex'' precision to accelerate the solution of Ax=b while maintaining single-complex precision accuracy. The proposed solver requires a matrix multiplication kernel that can accept half-complex inputs. We discuss two possible designs for such a kernel, and integrate both of them into a mixed-precision LU factorization. The other component of our solution is an iterative refinement solver, which recovers the single-complex accuracy using a preconditioned GMRES solver. Our experiments, which are conducted on a V100 GPU, show that the mixed-precision solver can be up to 2.5x faster than a full single-complex precision solver."

These solutions must yield high-confidence insights and answers to our Nation\u2019s most critical problems and challenges in scientific discovery, energy assurance, economic competitiveness, health enhancement, and national security.<br><br>Exascale applications (and their companion co-designed computational motifs) are a foundational element of the ECP and are the vehicle for delivery of consequential solutions and insight from exascale systems. The breadth of these applications runs the gamut: chemistry and materials; energy production and transmission; earth and space science; data analytics and optimization; and national security. Each ECP application is focused on targeted development to address a unique mission challenge problem, i.e., one that possesses solution amenable to simulation insight, represents a strategic problem important to a DOE mission program, and is currently intractable without the computational power of exascale. Any tangible progress requires close coordination between exascale application and software ecosystem development to adequately address the application development challenges currently encountered in the ECP: flat performance profiles; strong scaling; understanding accelerator performance; choice of programming model; selecting math models to fit architectures; and software dependencies.<br><br>Each ECP application possesses a unique development plan base on its requirements-based combination of physical model enhancements and additions, algorithm innovations and improvements, and software architecture design and implementation. Illustrative examples of these development activities will be given along with results achieved to date on existing DOE supercomputers such as the Summit system at Oak Ridge National Laboratory."

      "description": "The parallel multigrid method is expected to play an important role in large-scale scientific computing on exa-scale supercomputer systems. Previously we proposed Hierarchical Coarse Grid Aggregation (hCGA), which dramatically improved the performance of the parallel multigrid solver when the number of MPI processes was O(10^4) or more. Because hCGA can handle only two layers of parallel hierarchical levels, the computation overhead due to coarse grid solver may become significant when the number of MPI processes reaches O(10^5)- O(10^6) or more. In the present work, we propose AM-hCGA (Adaptive Multilevel hCGA) that can take into account multiple layers of three or more levels, and show preliminary results using the Oakforest-PACS (OFP) system by JCAHPC. Additionally, we also examine the impact of a lightweight multi-kernel operating system, called IHK/McKernel, for parallel multigrid solvers running on OFP."

Eventually, this requires finer geometric discretizations with larger numbers of mesh elements. In this context, and extrapolating to the Exascale paradigm, meshing operations such as generation, adaptation or partition, become a critical issue within the simulation workflow. In this paper, we focus on mesh partitioning. In particular, we present some improvements carried out on an in-house parallel mesh partitioner based on the Hilbert Space-Filling Curve. <br><br>Additionally, taking advantage of its performance, we present the application of the SFC-based partitioning for dynamic load balancing. This method is based on the direct monitoring of the imbalance at runtime and the subsequent re-partitioning of the mesh. The target weights for the optimized partitions are evaluated using a least-squares approximation considering all measurements from previous iterations. In this way, the final partition corresponds to the average performance of the computing devices engaged. Results of this strategy are presented for both homogeneous and heterogeneous executions, including CPU and GPU accelerators."

      "description": "Novel scalable scientific algorithms are needed in order to enable key science applications to exploit the computational power of large-scale systems. This is especially true for the current tier of leading petascale and machines and the road to exascale computing as HPC systems continue to scale up in compute node and processor core count. These extreme-scale systems require novel scientific algorithms to hide network and memory latency, have very high computation/communication overlap, have minimal communication, and have no synchronization points. With the advent of Big Data and AI in the past few years, the need of such scalable mathematical methods and algorithms able to handle data and compute intensive applications at scale becomes even more important.<br><br>Scientific algorithms for multi-petaflop and exaflop systems also need to be fault tolerant and fault resilient, since the probability of faults increases with scale. Resilience at the system software and at the algorithmic level is needed as a crosscutting effort. Finally, with the advent of heterogeneous compute nodes that employ standard processors as well as GPGPUs, scientific algorithms need to match these architectures to extract the most performance. This includes different system-specific levels of parallelism as well as co-scheduling of computation. Key science applications require novel mathematics and mathematical models and system software that address the scalability and resilience challenges of current- and future-generation extreme-scale HPC systems.<br><br><a href=\"https://www.csm.ornl.gov/srt/conferences/Scala/2019\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.csm.ornl.gov/srt/conferences/Scala/2019</a>"

      "description": "Ensuring correctness in high-performance computing (HPC) applications is one of the fundamental challenges that the HPC community faces today.  While significant advances in verification, testing, and debugging have been made to isolate software errors (or defects) in the context of non-HPC software, several factors make achieving correctness in HPC applications and systems much more challenging than in general systems software\u2014growing heterogeneity (architectures with CPUs, GPUs, and special purpose accelerators), massive scale computations (very high degree of concurrency), use of combined parallel programing models (e.g., MPI+X), new scalable numerical algorithms (e.g., to leverage reduced precision in floating-point arithmetic),  and aggressive compiler optimizations/transformations are some of the challenges that make correctness harder in HPC. As the complexity of future architectures, algorithms, and applications in HPC increases, the ability to fully exploit exascale systems will be limited without correctness.  With the continuous use of HPC software to advance scientific and technological capabilities, novel techniques and practical tools for software correctness in HPC are invaluable.  The goal of the Correctness Workshop is to bring together researchers and developers to present and discuss novel ideas to address the problem of correctness in HPC. The workshop will feature contributed papers and invited talks in this area."

We also outline differences in the  evaluation  of  dynamic  and  static  data  race  detection  tools.On top of the evaluation results, we further explore and suggest different  ways  to  process  and  present  the  data,  with  focus  on how to consider tool errors.

Our approach is state-based, relying on a formalism called Alloy to show that one model is a refinement of another.  We present examples of sparse matrix-vector multiplication, transpose, and translation between formats using ELLPACK and compressed sparse row formats to demonstrate the approach.  To model matrix computations in a declarative language like Alloy, a new idiom is presented for bounded iteration with incremental updates.  Mechanical verification is performed using SAT solvers built into the tool."

      "description": "Earth system models (ESMs) are computationally expensive and represent many complex processes on a wide range of scales from molecular to global. Certain ESM computations require high-precision while others, such as atmospheric microphysics (e.g., precipitation) which are approximated by bulk properties, should not. As such, atmospheric microphysics models are prime candidates for conversion to single-precision, which afford distinct computational and memory advantages over typical double-precision numbers. However, care must be taken as indiscriminate type casting to single precision can result in numerical instability and divergent output when applied naively. In this work we relate our experiences attempting to improve the performance of the Morrison-Gettelman microphysics package (MG2) in a popular ESM by modifying it to compute in single precision without sacrificing correctness. We find that modification of the entire MG2 package to compute with single-precision floats achieves a respectable performance increase but does not appear to be correct in terms of maintaining consistency with double-precision MG2. On the other hand, narrowing the scope of our conversion to a couple expensive subprograms yields more satisfying results in terms of correctness but with negligible overall performance improvement. We evaluate correctness with both an objective statistical tool and traditional approaches more familiar to climate scientists. While we are still working toward our ultimate goal of improving the performance of MG2 without negatively affecting model output, we believe that our experiences may be helpful to other groups pursuing similar goals."

      "description": "Ensuring correctness in high-performance computing (HPC) applications is one of the fundamental challenges that the HPC community faces today. While significant advances in verification, testing, and debugging have been made to isolate software errors (or defects) in the context of non-HPC software, several factors make achieving correctness in HPC applications and systems much more challenging than in general systems software\u2014growing heterogeneity (architectures with CPUs, GPUs, and special purpose accelerators), massive scale computations (very high degree of concurrency), use of combined parallel programing models (e.g., MPI+X), new scalable numerical algorithms (e.g., to leverage reduced precision in floating-point arithmetic), and aggressive compiler optimizations/transformations are some of the challenges that make correctness harder in HPC. As the complexity of future architectures, algorithms, and applications in HPC increases, the ability to fully exploit exascale systems will be limited without correctness. With the continuous use of HPC software to advance scientific and technological capabilities, novel techniques and practical tools for software correctness in HPC are invaluable. The goal of the Correctness Workshop is to bring together researchers and developers to present and discuss novel ideas to address the problem of correctness in HPC. The workshop will feature contributed papers and invited talks in this area.<br><br><a href=\"https://correctness-workshop.github.io/2019/\" target=\"_blank\"> https://correctness-workshop.github.io/2019/</a>"

      "description": "Due to the heterogeneous data sets they process, data intensive applications employ a diverse set of methods and data structures, exhibiting irregular memory accesses, control flows, and communication patterns. Current supercomputing systems are organized around components optimized for data locality and bulk synchronous computations. Managing any form of irregularity on them demands substantial programming effort, and often leads to poor performance. Holistic solutions to these challenges emerge only by considering the problem from multiple perspectives: from micro- to system-architectures, from compilers to languages, from libraries to runtimes, and from algorithm design to data characteristics. Only strong collaborative efforts among researchers with different expertise, including domain experts and end users, can lead to significant breakthroughs. This workshop brings together scientists with different backgrounds to discuss methods and technologies for efficiently supporting irregular applications on current and future architectures."

      "description": "We report on a software package that offers high-bandwidth and memory-efficient ways for a parallel application to transmit numerous small data items among its processes.  The package provides a standalone library that can integrated into any SHMEM, UPC, or MPI application.  It defines a simple interface to parallel objects called conveyors, and it provides a variety of conveyor implementations.  Often the most efficient type of conveyor is an asynchronous three-hop conveyor, which makes heavy use of fast intranode communication.  This type also uses the least memory internally.  Conveyors of this type scale well to 100,000 processes and beyond.<br><br>Our experience with conveyors applied to irregular algorithms at scale has convinced us of the necessity and profitability of message aggregation.  The conveyor interface is a low-level C API that is intended to guide future hardware and runtime improvements and to be a foundation for future parallel programming models."

      "description": "This paper proposes priority- and weight-based steal strategies for an idle worker (thief) to select a victim worker in work-stealing frameworks. Typical work-stealing frameworks employ uniformly random victim selection. We implemented the proposed strategies on a work-stealing framework called Tascell; Tascell programmers can let each worker estimate and declare, as a real number, the amount of remaining work required to complete its current task so that declared values are used as priorities or weights in the enhanced Tascell framework. To reduce the total task-division cost, the proposed strategies avoid stealing small tasks. With a priority-based strategy, a thief selects the victim that has the highest known priority at that point in time. With a weight-based non-uniformly random strategy, a thief uses the relative weights of victim candidates as their selection probabilities. The proposed selection strategies outperformed uniformly random victim selection. Our evaluation uses a parallel implementation of the \"highly serial'' version of the Barnes-Hut force-calculation algorithm in a shared memory environment and five benchmark programs in a distributed memory environment."

      "description": "Distributed data structures are key to implementing scalable applications for scientific simulations and data analysis.  In this paper we look at two implementation styles for distributed data structures: remote direct memory access (RDMA) and remote procedure call (RPC).  We focus on operations that require individual accesses to remote portions of a distributed data structure, e.g., accessing a hash table bucket or distributed queue, rather than global operations in which all processors collectively exchange information.  We look at the trade-offs between the two styles through microbenchmarks and a performance model that approximates the cost of each.  The RDMA operations have direct hardware support in the network and therefore lower latency and overhead, while the RPC operations are more expressive but higher cost and can suffer from lack of attentiveness from the remote side.   We also run experiments to compare the real-world performance of RDMA- and RPC-based data structure operations with the predicted performance to evaluate the accuracy of our model, and show that while the model does not always precisely predict running time, it allows us to choose the best implementation in the examples shown.  We believe this analysis will assist developers in designing data structures that will perform well on current network architectures, as well as network architects in providing better support for this class of distributed data structures."

The new implementation reduces memory traffic by using the half-precision format for some critical computations while maintaining double-precision solution accuracy. As the linear-solver kernel is memory bound on GPUs, a reduction in memory traffic directly translates to improved performance. The performance of the new implementation is assessed for a benchmark steady flow simulation and a large-scale unsteady turbulent flow application. Both studies were conducted using NVIDIA\u00ae Tesla V100 GPUs on the Summit system at the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility."

      "description": "The computation of tomographic reconstructors (ToR) is at the core of a simulation framework to design the next generation of adaptive optics (AO) systems to be installed on future Extremely Large Telescopes (ELT). In fact, it is also a critical component for their operation on sky.  The goals of these instruments range from the detection of the light from the most distant galaxies to the analysis of the composition of exoplanets terrestrial atmospheres.  Based on advanced AO techniques, the instrument MOSAIC relies on a computational framework to filter out the Earth atmospheric turbulence and eventually enhance the images quality out of ground-based telescopes. The ToR calculation is a compute-bound operation based on the Cholesky factorization.  Due to its cubical algorithmic complexity, the ToR may represent a major bottleneck for the E-ELT when scaling up the large number of wavefront sensors used in the baseline MOSAIC design.  To mitigate this increasing dimensionality overhead, this paper presents the implementation of a novel mixed-precision Cholesky-based dense matrix solver on hardware accelerators.  The new algorithm takes into account the data-sparse structure of the covariance matrix operator and uses the tensor cores of NVIDIA V100 GPUs to leverage performance at an unprecedented scale.  To our knowledge, this is the first computational astronomy application that exploits V100's tensor cores outside of the traditional arena of artificial intelligence.  Experimental results demonstrate the accuracy robustness and the high performance of the mixed-precision ToR on synthetic datasets, which paves the way for future instrument deployments on the E-ELT"

      "description": "Over the last decade, the vertex-centric programming model has attracted significant attention in the world of graph processing, resulting in the emergence of a number of  vertex-centric frameworks. Its simple programming interface, where computation is expressed from a vertex point of view, offers both ease of programming to the user and inherent parallelism for the underlying framework to leverage.<br><br>However, vertex-centric programs represent an extreme form of irregularity, both inter and intra core. This is because they exhibit a variety of challenges from a workload that may greatly vary across supersteps, through fine-grain synchronisations, to memory accesses that are unpredictable both in terms of quantity and location.<br><br>In this paper, we explore three optimisations which address these irregular challenges; a hybrid combiner carefully coupling lock-free and lock-based combinations, the partial externalisation of vertex structures to improve locality and the shift to an edge-centric representation of the workload. We also assess the suitability of more traditional optimisations such as dynamic load-balancing and software prefetching.<br><br>The optimisations were integrated into the iPregel vertex-centric framework, enabling the evaluation of each optimisation in the context of graph processing across three general purpose benchmarks common in the vertex-centric community, each run on four publicly available graphs covering all orders of magnitude from a million to a billion edges.<br><br>The result of this work is a set of techniques which we believe not only provide a significant performance improvement in vertex-centric graph processing, but are also applicable more generally to irregular applications."

      "description": "Given enough parallel compute units, the processing time for sparse (in-)complete factorization is determined by the number of level sets found in the pattern of the matrix. For positive definite or diagonal dominant matrices, the iterative Jacobi-method presents itself as a scalable alternative on massively-parallel systems. In this work, we present modifications to the Jacobi algorithm, extending its applicability to a wider class of matrices.  Our approach cuts the matrix into blocks to allow register-based pivoting in batched CUDA factorization kernels and, for the first time on GPUs, also flexible permutations on the block level in an a posteriori threshold full pivoting scheme.  Experiments show our batched kernels to be on par with partially pivoted approaches and the resulting sparse factorizations compare favorable in quality and speed with their traditionally scheduled counterparts."

      "description": "Vector gather instructions are responsible for handling indirect memory accesses in vector processing. Since the indirect memory accesses usually express irregular access patterns, they have relatively low spatial and temporal locality compared with regular access patterns. As a result, an application with many vector gather instructions suffers from long latencies of the indirect memory accesses. Thus, the long latencies cause a significant performance degradation in vector processing.<br><br>This paper proposes a hardware prefetching mechanism to hide memory access latencies of indirect memory accesses. The mechanism prefetches cacheable index data before executing a vector gather instruction, and predicts the addresses of the memory requests issued by the vector gather instruction. The mechanism then tries to prefetch the data based on the predicted addresses. As a result, the mechanism can reduce the memory access latencies of vector gather instructions. Moreover, this paper discusses how many cache blocks should be loaded per prediction regarding a single vector gather instruction by varying the prefetching parameters of distance and degree. In the evaluation, the performance of a simple kernel is examined with two types of index data: sequential and random. The evaluation results show that the prefetching mechanism improves the performance of the sequential-indexed and random-indexed kernels by 2.2x and 1.2x, respectively."

      "description": "Graph processing is typically considered to be a memory-bound rather than compute-bound problem. One common line of thought is that more available memory bandwidth corresponds to better graph processing performance. However, in this work we demonstrate that the key factor in the utilization of the memory system for graph algorithms is not necessarily the raw bandwidth or even the latency of memory requests. Instead, we show that performance is proportional to the number of memory channels available to handle small data transfers with limited spatial locality.<br><br>Using several widely used graph frameworks, including Gunrock (on the GPU) and GAPBS and Ligra (for CPUs), we evaluate key graph analytics kernels using two unique memory hierarchies, DDR-based and HBM/MCDRAM. Our results show that the differences in the peak bandwidths of several Pascal-generation GPU memory subsystems aren't reflected in the performance of various analytics. Furthermore, our experiments on CPU and Xeon Phi systems (see arXiv extended version) demonstrate that the number of memory channels utilized can be a decisive factor in performance across several different applications. For CPU systems with smaller thread counts, the memory channels can be underutilized while systems with high thread counts can oversaturate the memory subsystem, which leads to limited performance. Finally, we model the potential performance improvements of adding more memory channels with narrower access widths than are found in current platforms. We analyze performance trade-offs for the two most prominent types of memory accesses found in graph algorithms, streaming and random accesses."

      "description": "Indirect memory accesses caused by sparse linear algebra calculations are widely used in important real applications.  However, they also cause serious inefficient memory accesses and pipeline stalls resulting in low execution efficiency even with high memory bandwidth and much computational resource.  One of the important issues of indirect memory accesses, such as accessing A[B[i]], is it requires two successive memory accesses: the index loads (B[i]) and the following data element accesses (A[B[i]]).  To overcome this situation, we propose the Cascaded-DMAC (CDMAC).  This CDMAC is intended to be attached in each core of a multicore chip in addition to a CPU core, a vector accelerator, and a local data memory.  It performs data transfers between an off-chip main memory and an in-core local data memory, which provides data to the accelerator.  The key idea of the CDMAC is cascading two DMACs so that the first one loads indices, then the second one accesses data elements by using these indices.  Thus, this organization realizes the autonomous indirect memory accesses by giving an index array and an element array, and obtains the efficient SIMD computations by lining up the sparse data into the local data memory.  We implemented a multicore processor having the proposed CDMAC on an FPGA board.  The evaluation result of sparse matrix-vector multiplications on the FPGA shows that the CDMAC achieves a maximum speedup of 17x compared with the CPU data transfer."

Current supercomputing systems are organized around components optimized for data locality and bulk synchronous computations. Managing any form of irregularity on them demands substantial programming effort, and often leads to poor performance. Holistic solutions to these challenges emerge only by considering the problem from multiple perspectives: from micro- to system-architectures, from compilers to languages, from libraries to runtimes, and from algorithm design to data characteristics. Only strong collaborative efforts among researchers with different expertise, including domain experts and end users, can lead to significant breakthroughs.

      "description": "Effective visualization of time-varying volumetric data is considered challenging, since in addition to the traditional visualization parameter selections, there is also the need to take care about the dynamic changings between the timesteps. In situ adaptive sampling control based on the amount of change between the simulation timepsteps might be helpful for the I/O and visualization cost savings. In this paper, we propose the use of Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) and Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, in order to estimate the amount of internal variations between the timesteps, and use this parameter for controlling the sampling rate of the timesteps. Needless to say that these selected timesteps should be sufficient to understand the underlying phenomena without missing important data features. We confirmed the effectiveness on reducing the number of timepsteps, by using a CFD simulation of irregular volume data by using OpenFOAM. However, we could also observe that some parameter selection highly influences the visualization smoothness, and this remains as a future work."

      "description": "Large-scale computer simulations generate data at rates that necessitate visual analysis tools to run in situ.  The distribution of work on and across nodes of a supercomputer is crucial to utilize compute resources as efficiently as possible.  In this paper, we study two work distribution problems in the context of in situ visualization and jointly assess the performance impact of different variants.  First, especially for simulations involving heterogeneous loads across their domain, dynamic load balancing can significantly reduce simulation run times.  However, the adjustment of the domain partitioning associated with this also has a direct impact on visualization performance.  The exact impact of this is side effect is largely unclear a priori as generally different criteria are used for balancing simulation and visualization load.  Second, on node level, the adequate allocation of threads to simulation or visualization tasks minimizes the performance drain of the simulation while also enabling timely visualization results.  In our case study, we jointly study both work distribution aspects with the visualization framework MegaMol coupled in situ on node level to the molecular dynamics simulation ls1 Mardyn on Stampede2 at TACC."

One aspect of in situ analysis that has not been extensively researched to date, however, is elasticity. Current in situ analysis frameworks use a fixed amount of resources and can hardly be scaled up or down dynamically throughout the simulation's run time as a response to changes in the requirements.<br><br>In this paper, we present the challenges posed by elastic in situ analysis and visualization. We emphasize that elasticity can take various forms. We show the difficulties of supporting each form of elasticity with the state-of-the-art HPC technologies, and we suggest solutions to overcome these difficulties. The resulting four-way classification can be seen as a taxonomy for future elastic in situ analysis and visualization systems."

Our experiments consist of parallelism at 512 cores, a data set with 67 million cells, and ten billion total advection steps. Our findings show that parallelizing over particles can be more than ten times faster for some workloads, for reasonable memory cost. Overall, the significance of these findings is to demonstrate that moving data can be worthwhile in some in situ settings."

One challenge users often face in adopting in-situ techniques is setting the right environment on a target machine. Platforms such as SENSEI require complex software stacks that consist of various analysis packages and visualization applications. The user has to make sure all these prerequisites exist on the target machine, which often involves compiling and setting them up from scratch. In this paper, we leverage the containers technology (e.g., light-weight virtualization images) and provide users with Singularity containers that encapsulate ready-to-use, movable in-situ software stacks. Moreover, we make use of Spack to ease the process of creating these containers. Finally, we evaluate this solution by running in-situ analysis from within a container on an HPC system."

We investigate the performance characteristics of an in transit data transport mechanism that leverages the HDF5 parallel I/O library and is accessible as one of several different in transit transport mechanisms in the SENSEI generic in situ framework. For in transit use cases at scale on HPC platforms, one might expect that an in transit data transport mechanism that uses faster layers of the storage hierarchy, such as DRAM memory, would always outperform a transport that uses slower layers of the storage hierarchy, such as an NVRAM-based persistent storage presented as a distributed file system. However, our results show that the performance of the transport using NVRAM is competitive with the transport that uses socket-based data movement across varying levels of producer and consumer concurrency."

It is found that both frameworks can be used for batch and interactive visualization commonly conducted by researchers and engineers. The in situ approach costs less to implement in applications and is easier to use. Conversely, the in transit approach is advantageous in terms of lower execution overhead and its flexibility for using separate resources in a heterogeneous HPC system. It is therefore desirable to use both approaches as needed. Based on the knowledge obtained herein, this paper summarizes suggestions for research and development of the in situ and in transit visualization frameworks, the HPC system, and queue policy for interactive jobs, in order to realize in situ and in transit visualization in a heterogeneous HPC system."

      "description": "In an M to N in transit setting,  a simulation runs on M MPI ranks while an endpoint, such as analysis or visualization, runs on N MPI ranks in a separate application. Before data is moved or processed, a partitioning step occurs where decisions are made about how data is mapped from the simulation's M MPI ranks onto the end-point's N MPI ranks.  We investigate metadata enabled, optimized partitioning for M to N in transit processing. We extended the SENSEI generic in situ infrastructure for M to N in transit processing. The design incorporates a partitioner object and API that is used to compute the mapping of simulation data onto end-point resources, and a metadata object that comprehensively yet compactly describes data and its mapping onto MPI ranks. In a scaling study using up to 16384 cores on NERSC's Cori system, we compare optimized and unoptimized partitioning approaches for two common analysis operations, slicing and isosurfacing, and vary N, the level of end-point concurrency, and show optimal ratios of M to N for both types of end-point operations and partitioners.  We find that metadata enabled partitioning optimizations significantly reduce time to solution, amount of data moved, memory footprint, and cost of solution in node hours, especially when running in the regime where N << M."

While we have access to fully featured visualization UIs through tools like ParaView Catalyst and VisIt LibSim, we lack in situ in- frastructure to access more general interactive environments like Jupyter. The Jupyter ecosystem of tools provides a rich paradigm for interactive data analysis and is well suited to help expand inter- active use of in situ. The complexity of the Jupyter ecosystem and HPC center security requirements pose challenges to develop soft- ware infrastructure that enables direct use of Jupyter in simulation codes.<br><br>With this work, we describe a system that enables simulations instrumented with Ascent to connect to Jupyter. This system allows simulation users to interact with their data in situ using Jupyter Notebooks. The system combines Ascent\u2019s embedded Python filter infrastructure with a Client/Server Jupyter Bridge Kernel design that simplifies both deployment and security considerations on HPC systems. We describe the design of this system, demonstrate basic usage, and describe a prototype Ascent rendering UI built on top of this system."

There are two primary motivations for processing and managing data in situ. The first is the need to decrease data volume. The second motivation is that the in situ methodology can enable scientific discovery from a broad range of data sources, over a wide scale of computing platforms. This talk will highlight the findings of a recent U.S. Department of Energy workshop on in situ data management, outlining six priority research directions. The research directions identify the components and capabilities needed for in situ data management to be successful for a wide variety of applications: making in situ data management more pervasive, controllable, composable, and transparent, with a focus on greater coordination with the software stack, and a diversity of fundamentally new data algorithms."

The objectives of this one day workshop are to promote and stimulate researchers\u2019 interactions to address some of the most critical challenges for scientific data storage, management, devices, and processing infrastructure for both traditional compute intensive simulations and data-intensive high performance computing solutions. Special attention will be given to issues in which community collaboration can be crucial for problem identification, workload capture, solution interoperability, standards with community buy-in, and shared tools.<br><br>Many scientific problem domains continue to be extremely data intensive. Traditional HPC systems and the programming models for using them such as MPI were designed from a compute-centric perspective with an emphasis on achieving high floating point computation rates. But processing, memory, and storage technologies have not kept pace and there is a widening performance gap between computation and the data management infrastructure. Hence data management has become the performance bottleneck for a significant number of applications targeting HPC systems. Concurrently, there are increasing challenges in meeting the growing demand for analyzing experimental and observational data. In many cases, this is leading new communities to look toward HPC platforms. In addition, the broader computing space has seen a revolution in new tools and frameworks to support Big Data analytics and machine learning."

There is an explosion of data-driven frameworks including Presto, Hive, Spark, and MapReduce to run data analytics and ETL queries, as well as TensorFlow, PyTorch to train and serve models. On the data side, the approach to manage and store data has evolved from HDFS to cheaper, more scalable and separated services typified by cloud object stores like AWS S3. Data engineering has become increasingly complex, inefficient, and hard, particularly in the hybrid and cloud environments.<br><br>Alluxio Open Source Software is to address these challenges. Alluxio, born from UC Berkeley AMPLab, is a data orchestration system that provides a unified data access and caching layer for single cloud, hybrid and multi-cloud deployments. Alluxio enables distributed compute engines like Presto, Hive, or TensorFlow to transparently access data from various storage systems (including S3, HDFS, Azure etc.) while actively leveraging in-memory cache to accelerate data access.

      "description": "Python-written data analytics applications can be modeled as and compiled into a directed acyclic graph (DAG) based workflow, where the nodes are fine-grained tasks and the edges are task dependencies.  Such analytics workflow jobs are increasingly characterized by short, fine-grained tasks with large fan-outs. These characteristics make them well-suited for a new cloud computing model called serverless computing or Function-as-a-Service (FaaS), which has become prevalent in recent years. The auto-scaling property of serverless computing platforms accommodates short tasks and bursty workloads, while the pay-per-use billing model of serverless computing providers keeps the cost of short tasks low. <br><br>In this paper, we thoroughly investigate the problem space of DAG scheduling in serverless computing. We identify and evaluate a set of techniques to make DAG schedulers serverless-aware. These techniques have been implemented in WUKONG, a serverless, DAG scheduler attuned to AWS Lambda. WUKONG provides decentralized scheduling through a combination of static and dynamic scheduling. We present the results of an empirical study in which WUKONG is applied to a range of microbenchmark and real-world DAG applications. Results demonstrate the efficacy of WUKONG in minimizing the performance overhead introduced by AWS Lambda \u2014 WUKONG achieves competitive performance compared to a serverful DAG scheduler, while improving the performance of real-world DAG jobs by as much as 3.1\u00d7 at larger scale."

      "description": "With scientific applications moving toward exascale levels, an increasing amount of data is being produced and analyzed. Providing efficient data access is crucial to the productivity of the scientific discovery process. Compared to improvements in CPU and network speeds, I/O performance lags far behind, such that moving data across the storage hierarchy can take longer than data generation or analysis. To alleviate this I/O bottleneck, asynchronous read and write operations have been provided by the POSIX and MPI-I/O interfaces and can overlap I/O operations with computation, and thus hide I/O latency. However, these standards lack support for non-data operations such as file open, stat, and close, and their read and write operations require users to both manually manage data dependencies and use low-level byte offsets. This requires significant effort and expertise for applications to utilize.<br><br>To overcome these issues, we present an asynchronous I/O framework that provides support for all I/O operations and manages data dependencies transparently and automatically. Our prototype asynchronous I/O implementation as an HDF5 VOL connector demonstrates the effectiveness of hiding the I/O cost from the application with a low overhead and easy-to-use programming interface."

      "description": "Parallel I/O is an indispensable part of scientific applications.  The current stack of parallel I/O contains many tunable parameters.  While changing these parameters can increase I/O performance many-fold, the application developers usually resort to default values because tuning is a cumbersome process and requires expertise.  We propose two auto-tuning models, based on active learning that recommend a good set of parameter values (currently tested with Lustre parameters and MPI-IO hints) for an application on a given system.  These models use Bayesian optimization to find the values of parameters by minimizing an objective function.  The first model runs the application to determine these values, whereas, the second model uses an I/O prediction model for the same.  Thus the training time is significantly reduced in comparison to the first model (e.g., from 800 seconds to 18 seconds).  Also both the models provide flexibility to focus on improvement of either read or write performance.  To keep the tuning process generic, we have focused on both read and write performance.  We have validated our models using an I/O benchmark (IOR) and 3 scientific application I/O kernels (S3D-IO, BT-IO and GenericIO) on two supercomputers (HPC2010 and Cori).  Using the two models, we achieve an increase in I/O bandwidth of up to 11x over the default parameters.  We got up to 3x improvements for 37 TB writes, corresponding to 1 billion particles in GenericIO.  We also achieved up to 3.2x higher bandwidth for 4.8 TB of non-contiguous I/O in BT-IO benchmark."

      "description": "In high-performance computing (HPC), I/O performance prediction offers the potential to improve the efficiency of scientific computing. In particular, accurate prediction can make runtime estimates more precise, guide users toward optimal checkpoint strategies, and better inform facility provisioning and scheduling policies. HPC I/O performance is notoriously difficult to predict and model, however, in large part because of inherent variability and a lack of transparency in the behaviors of constituent storage system components. In this work we seek to advance the state of the art in HPC I/O performance prediction by (1) modeling the mean performance to address high variability, (2) deriving model features from write patterns, system architecture and system configurations, and (3) employing Lasso regression model to improve model accuracy. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by applying it to a crucial subset of common HPC I/O motifs, namely, file-per-process checkpoint write workloads. We conduct experiments on two distinct production HPC platforms\u2014Titan at the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility and Cetus at the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility\u2014to train and evaluate our models. We find that we can attain \u2264 30% relative error for 92.79% and 99.64% of the samples in our test set on these platforms, respectively."

      "description": "In the post-Moore era, systems and devices with new architectures will arrive at a rapid rate with significant impacts on the software stack. Applications will not be able to fully benefit from new architectures unless they can delegate adapting to new devices to lower layers in the stack. In this paper we introduce physical design management which deals with the problem of identifying and executing transformations on physical designs of stored data -- i.e. how data is mapped to storage abstractions like files, objects, or blocks -- in order to improve performance. Physical design is traditionally placed with applications, access libraries, and databases, using hard-wired assumptions about underlying storage systems. Yet, storage systems increasingly not only contain multiple kinds of storage devices with vastly different performance profiles but also move data among those storage devices, thereby changing the benefit of a particular physical design. We advocate placing physical design management in storage, identify interesting research challenges, provide a brief description of a prototype implementation in Ceph, and discuss the results of initial experiments at scale that are digitally replicable using CloudLab. These experiments show performance and resource utilization trade-offs associated with choosing different physical designs and choosing to transform between physical designs."

      "description": "With the increasing complexity of memory and storage, it is important to automate the decision of how to assign data structures to memory and storage devices.  On one hand, this requires developing models to reconcile application access patterns against the limited capacity of higher-performance devices.  On the other, such a modeling task demands a set of primitives to build from, and a toolkit that implements those primitives in a robust, dynamic fashion.  We focus on the latter problem, and to that end we present an interface that abstracts the physical layout of data from the application developer.  This will allow the developers of memory cost models to use our abstracta as the basis for their implementation, while application developers will see a unified, scalable, and resilient memory environment."

Through this case study, we demonstrate that IO500 serves as a meaningful, widely applicable storage benchmark, even for all flash storage. We also demonstrate that using fine-grained profiling tools, such as Mistral, is essential for revealing tuning requirement details. Overall, this paper provides a methodology and set of tools that can be used to analyze storage system performance to inform tuning for other large-scale supercomputers."

      "description": "The utilization and performance of storage, compute, and network resources within HPC data centers have been studied extensively, but much less work has gone towards characterizing how these resources are used in conjunction to solve larger scientific challenges.  To address this gap, we present our work towards characterizing workloads and workflows at a data center-wide level by examining all data transfers that occurred between storage, compute, and the external network at the National Energy Research Scientific Computhing Center (NERSC) over a three-month period.  Using a simple abstract representation of data transfers, we analyze over 100 million transfer logs from Darshan, HPSS user interfaces, and Globus to quantify the load on data paths between compute, storage, and the wide-area network based on transfer direction, user, transfer tool, source, destination, and time.  We show that parallel I/O from user jobs, while undeniably important, is only one of several major I/O workloads that occurs throughout the execution of scientific workflows.  We also show that this approach can be used to connect anomalous data traffic to specific users and file access patterns, and we construct time-resolved user transfer traces to demonstrate that it is possible to systematically identify coupled data motion for individual workflows."

The objectives of this one day workshop are to promote and stimulate researchers\u2019 interactions to address some of the most critical challenges for scientific data storage, management, devices, and processing infrastructure for both traditional compute intensive simulations and data-intensive high performance computing solutions. Special attention will be given to issues in which community collaboration can be crucial for problem identification, workload capture, solution interoperability, standards with community buy-in, and shared tools.<br><br>Many scientific problem domains continue to be extremely data intensive. Traditional HPC systems and the programming models for using them such as MPI were designed from a compute-centric perspective with an emphasis on achieving high floating point computation rates. But processing, memory, and storage technologies have not kept pace and there is a widening performance gap between computation and the data management infrastructure. Hence data management has become the performance bottleneck for a significant number of applications targeting HPC systems. Concurrently, there are increasing challenges in meeting the growing demand for analyzing experimental and observational data. In many cases, this is leading new communities to look toward HPC platforms. In addition, the broader computing space has seen a revolution in new tools and frameworks to support Big Data analytics and machine learning.<br><br><a href=\"http://www.pdsw.org\" target=\"_blank> http://www.pdsw.org</a>"

Last year Intel Optane DC Persistent Memory in DIMM (PMM) form-factor was introduced, which is capable of being used as main memory device. This technology promises faster memory access comparing to Intel Optane DC P4800X SSD with Intel Memory Drive Technology devices available previously.<br><br>In this paper, we present new benchmark data for the Intel Optane DC Persistent Memory. We studied the performance of scientific application from domains of quantum chemistry and computational astrophysics. To put performance of the Intel Optane DC PMM in comparison, we used two memory configurations: DDR4 only system and Optane DC SSD with Intel Memory Drive Technology (IMDT) that is another option for memory extension. We see that PMM is superior to IMDT in almost all our benchmarks, to no surprise. However, PMM was 20-30% more performant in quantum chemistry and only marginally better for astrophysics simulations. We also found, that for practical calculations hybrid setup demonstrates on the same order of magnitude performance as DDR4 system."

      "description": "Applications that operate on sparse data induce irregular data access patterns and cannot take full advantage of caches and prefetching. Novel hardware architectures have been proposed to address the disparity between processor and memory speeds by moving computation closer to memory. One such architecture is the Emu system, which employs light-weight threads that migrate to the location of the data being accessed. While smart heuristics and profile-guided techniques have been developed to derive good data layouts for traditional machines, these methods are largely ineffective when applied to a migratory thread architecture. In this work, we present an application-independent framework for data layout optimizations that targets the Emu architecture. We discuss the necessary tools and concepts to facilitate such optimizations, including a data-centric profiler, data distribution library, and cost model. To demonstrate the framework, we have designed a block placement optimization that distributes blocks of data across the system such that access latency is reduced. The optimization was applied towards sparse matrix-vector multiplication on an Emu FPGA implementation, achieving a geometric mean speed up of 12.5% across 57 matrices. Only one matrix experienced a loss of performance of 6%, while the maximum runtime speedup was 50%."

      "description": "This paper describes the performance optimization of hyperplane ordering methods applied to the high cost routine of the turbine simulation code called \u201cNumerical Turbine\u201d for the newest vector supercomputer. The Numerical Turbine code is a computational fluid dynamics code developed at Tohoku University, which can execute large-scale parallel calculation of the entire thermal flow through multistage cascades of gas and steam turbines. The Numerical Turbine code is a memory- intensive application that requires a high memory bandwidth to achieve a high sustained performance.  For this reason, it is implemented in a vector supercomputer equipped with a high-performance memory subsystem. The main performance bottleneck of the Numerical Turbine code is the time-integration routine. To vectorize the lower-upper symmetric Gauss-Seidel method used in this time integration routine, a hyperplane ordering method is used. We clarify the problems of the current hyperplane ordering methods for the newest vector supercomputer NEC SX-Aurora TSUBASA and propose an optimized hyperplane ordering method that changes the data layout in the memory to resolve this bottleneck. Through the performance evaluation, it is clarified that the proposed hyperplane ordering can achieve further improvement of the performance by up to 2.77x, and 1.27x on average."

      "description": "Generalized sparse matrix-matrix multiplication (SpGEMM) is a key primitive kernel for many high-performance graph algorithms as well as for machine learning, and data analysis algorithms. Although many SpGEMM algorithms have been proposed, such as ESC and SPA, there is currently no SpGEMM kernel optimized for vector engines (VEs). NEC SX-Aurora is the new vector computing system that can achieve high performance by leveraging high bandwidth memory of 1.2TB/s and long vector of VEs, where the execution of scientific applications is limited by memory bandwidth. In this paper, we demonstrate significant initial work of SpGEMM kernel for a vector engine and implement it to vectorize several essential graph analysis algorithms: Butterfly counting and Triangle counting. We propose a SpGEMM algorithm with a novel hybrid method based on sparse vectors and loop raking to maximize the length of vectorizable code for vector machine architectures. The experimental results show that the vector engine has advantages on more massive data sets. This work contributes to high performance and portability of the SpGEMM kernel to a new family of heterogeneous computing systems, which is Vector Host (VH) equipped with different accelerators or VEs."

      "description": "Whole slide images(WSIs) are very large (30-50GB each in uncompressed format), multiple resolution tissue images produced by digital slide scanners, and are widely used by pathology departments for diagnostic, educational and research purposes. Content-based Image Retrieval (CBIR) applications allow pathologists to perform a sub-region search on WSIs to automatically identify image patterns that are consistent with a given query patch containing cancerous tissue patterns. The results can then be used to draw comparisons among patient samples in order to make informed decisions regarding likely prognoses and most appropriate treatment regimens, leading to new discoveries in precision and preventive medicine.<br>CBIR applications often require repeated, random or sequential access to WSIs, and most of the time the images are preprocessed into smaller tiles, as it is infeasible to bring the entire WSI into the memory of a computer node. In this study, we have designed and implemented a distributed deep memory hierarchy data staging system that leverages Solid-State Drives (SSDs) and provides an illusion of a very large memory space that can accommodate big WSI datasets and prevent subsequent accesses to the file system. An I/O intensive sequential CBIR workflow for searching cancerous patterns in prostate carcinoma datasets was parallelized and the I/O paths were altered to include the proposed memory system. Our results indicate that the parallel performance of the CBIR workflow improves and our deep memory hierarchy, staging framework produces negligible overheads for the application performance even when the number of staging servers and their memory sizes are limited."

UM automatically migrates page-level data on-demand so programmers can quickly write CUDA codes on heterogeneous machines without tedious and error-prone manual memory management. To improve performance, NVIDIA allows advanced programmers to pass additional memory use hints to its UM driver. However, it is extremely difficult for programmers to decide when and how to efficiently use unified memory, given the complex interactions between applications and hardware. In this paper, we present a machine learning-based approach to choosing between discrete memory and unified memory, with additional consideration of different memory hints. Our approach utilizes profiler-generated metrics of CUDA programs to train a model  offline, which is later used to guide optimal use of UM for multiple applications at runtime. We evaluate our approach on NVIDIA Volta GPU with a set of benchmarks. Results show that the proposed model achieves 96% prediction accuracy in correctly identifying the optimal memory advice choice."

Memory mapping files on different tiers of storage provides a uniform interface in applications. However, system-wide services like mmap are optimized for generality and lack flexibility for enabling application-specific optimizations. In this work, we present UMap to enable user-space page management that can be easily adapted to access patterns in applications and storage characteristics. UMap uses the userfaultfd mechanism to handle page faults in multi-threaded applications efficiently. By providing a data object abstraction layer, UMap is extensible to support various backing stores. The design of UMap supports dynamic load balancing and I/O decoupling for scalable performance. UMap also uses application hints to improve the selection of caching, prefetching, and eviction policies. We evaluate UMap in five benchmarks and real applications on two systems. Our results show that leveraging application knowledge for page management could substantially improve performance. On average, UMap achieved 1.25 to 2.5 times improvement  using the adapted configurations compared to the system service."

The approach requires users to program I/O operations for reading and writing data from and to storage, and to and from host memory. Then users are required to program operations for moving data between host memory and device memory. In this paper, we present our extension to the OpenMP map clause for programming directly reading and writing data between storage and device memory. The extension includes mechanism for handling metadata such that metadata can be manipulated independently from data itself. This work demonstrates a prototype runtime, and the support for binary and image data format, including jpeg and png, with OpenCV. Experiments on matrix and image processing kernels show that the designed extension can significantly reduce programming efforts for manipulating data and metadata among storage, host memory, and device memory."

      "description": "In the age of big data, deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool to extract insight and exploit its value, both in industry and scientific applications.  With increasing complexity of learning models and amounts of training data,  data-parallel approaches based on frequent all-reduce synchronization steps are increasingly popular. Despite the fact that high-performance computing  (HPC) technologies have been designed to address such patterns efficiently, the behavior of data-parallel approaches on HPC platforms is not well understood. To address this issue, in this paper we study the behavior of  Horovod,  a  popular data-parallel approach that relies on MPI,  on  Theta,  a pre-Exascale machine at  Argonne  National  Laboratory.  Using  two representative  applications,  we  explore  two  aspects:  (1)  how performance and scalability is affected by important parameters such as number of nodes, number of workers, threads per node, batch  size;  (2)  how  computational  phases  are  interleaved  withall-reduce  communication  phases  at  fine  granularity  and  what consequences  this  interleaving  has  in  terms  of  potential  bottlenecks.  Our findings show that pipelining of back-propagation, gradient reduction and weight updates mitigate the effects of stragglers during all-reduce only partially.  Furthermore,  there can be significant delays between weights update, which can be leveraged to mask the overhead of additional background operations that are coupled with the training."

NVIDIA's recent Volta architecture includes tensor cores which perform a fused operation reduced and mixed precision (16-bit multiply, 32-bit accumulate).  Recent research indicates that, typically, very little is lost (in terms of training accuracy) when half precision is used in place of single precision, and performance gains can be made by doing arithmetic in reduced precision.  In this work we demonstrate that making layer-by-layer choices as to the arithmetic/data precision can lead to further performance improvement.  In our study of 25,200 CNNs we demonstrate an average speedup (over purely half precision) of 1.27x and speedups as high as 3.64x by appropriately combining single and half precision arithmetic and data types on a layer-by-layer basis."

Massive parallelization on GPUs and distributed systems has been exploited to generate a large amount of training experiences and consequently reduce instabilities, but the success of training remains strongly influenced by the choice of the hyperparameters.  To overcome this issue, we introduce HyperTrick, a new metaoptimization algorithm, and show its effective application to tune hyperparameters in the case of deep RL, while learning to play different Atari games on a distributed system.  Our analysis provides evidence of the interaction between the identification of the optimal hyperparameters and the learned policy, that is peculiar of the case of metaoptimization for deep RL.  When compared with state-of-the-art metaoptimization algorithms, HyperTrick is characterized by a simpler implementation and it allows learning similar policies, while making a more effective use of the computational resources in a distributed system."

      "description": "Linear algebra algorithms are used widely in a variety of domains, e.g. machine learning, numerical physics and video games graphics. For all these applications, loop-level parallelism is required to achieve high performance. However, finding the optimal way to schedule the workload between threads is a non-trivial problem because it depends on the structure of the algorithm being parallelized and the hardware the executable is run on. In the realm of Asynchronous Many Task runtime systems, a key aspect of the scheduling problem is predicting the proper chunk-size, where the chunk-size is defined as the number of iterations of a for-loop are assigned to a thread as one task. In this paper, we study the applications of supervised learning models to predict the chunk-size which yields maximum performance on multiple parallel linear algebra operations using the HPX backend of Blaze's linear algebra library. More precisely, we generate our training and tests sets by measuring performance of the application with different chunk-sizes for multiple linear algebra operations; vector-addition, matrix-vector-multiplication, matrix-matrix addition and matrix-matrix-multiplication.  We compare the use of logistic regression, neural networks and decision trees with a newly developed decision tree based model in order to predict the optimal value for chunk-size. Our results show that classical decision trees and our custom decision tree model are able to forecast a chunk-size which results in good performance for the linear algebra operations."

      "description": "The Word2Vec model is a neural network-based unsupervised word embedding technique widely used in applications such as natural language processing, bioinformatics and graph mining. As Word2Vec repeatedly performs Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) to minimize the objective function, it is very compute-intensive. However, existing methods for parallelizing Word2Vec are not optimized enough for data locality to achieve high performance. In this paper, we develop a parallel data-locality-enhanced Word2Vec algorithm based on Skip-gram with a novel negative sampling method that decouples loss calculation with positive and negative samples; this allows us to efficiently reformulate matrix-matrix operations for the negative samples over the sentence. Experimental results demonstrate our parallel implementations on multi-core CPUs and GPUs achieve significant performance improvement over the existing state-of-the-art parallel Word2Vec implementations while maintaining evaluation quality. We also show the utility of our Word2Vec implementation within the Node2Vec algorithm which accelerates embedding learning for large graphs."

      "description": "Most machine learning methods require careful selection of hyper-parameters in order to train a high performing model with good generalization abilities. Hence, several automatic selection algorithms have been introduced to overcome tedious manual (try and error) tuning of these parameters. Due to its very high sample efficiency, Bayesian Optimization over a Gaussian Processes modeling of the parameter space has become the method of choice. Unfortunately, this approach suffers from a cubic compute complexity due to underlying Cholesky factorization, which makes it very hard to be scaled beyond a small number of sampling steps.<br><br>In this paper, we present a novel, highly accurate approximation of the underlying Gaussian Process. Reducing its computational complexity from cubic to quadratic allows an efficient strong scaling of Bayesian Optimization while outperforming the previous approach regarding optimization accuracy. First experiments show speedups of a factor of 162 in single node and further speed up by a factor of 5 in a parallel environment."

      "description": "Current training methods for deep neural networks boil down to very high dimensional and non-convex optimization problems which are usually solved by a wide range of stochastic gradient descent methods. While these approaches tend to work in practice, there are still many gaps in the theoretical understanding of key aspects like convergence and generalization guarantees, which are induced by the properties of the optimization surface (loss landscape). In order to gain deeper insights, a number of recent publications proposed methods to visualize and analyze the otimization surfaces. However, the computational cost of these methods are very high, making it hardly possible to use them on larger networks.<br><br>In this paper, we present the GradVis Toolbox, an open source library for efficient and scalable visualization and analysis of deep neural network loss landscapes in Tesorflow and PyTorch. Introducing more efficient mathematical formulations and a novel parallelization scheme, GradVis allows to plot 2d and 3d projections of optimization surfaces and trajectories, as well as high resolution second order gradient information for large networks."

      "description": "Extracting actionable insight from complex unlabeled scientific data is an open challenge and key to unlocking data-driven discovery in science. Complementary and alternative to supervised machine learning approaches, unsupervised physics-based methods based on behavior-driven theories hold great promise. Due to computational limitations, practical application on real-world domain science problems has lagged far behind theoretical development. However, powerful modern supercomputers provide the opportunity to narrow the gap between theory and practical application. We present our first step towards bridging this divide - DisCo - a high-performance distributed workflow for the behavior-driven local causal state theory. DisCo provides a scalable unsupervised physics-based representation learning method that decomposes spatiotemporal systems into their structurally relevant components, which are captured by the latent local causal state variables. In several firsts we demonstrate the efficacy of DisCo in capturing physically meaningful coherent structures from observational and simulated scientific data. To the best of our knowledge, DisCo is also the first application software developed entirely in Python to scale to over 1000 machine nodes, providing good performance along with ensuring domain scientists' productivity. Our capstone experiment, using newly developed and optimized DisCo workflow and libraries, performs unsupervised spacetime segmentation analysis of CAM5.1 climate simulation data, processing an unprecedented 89.5 TB in 6.6 minutes end-to-end using 1024 Intel Haswell nodes on the Cori supercomputer obtaining 91% weak-scaling and 64% strong-scaling efficiency. This enables us to achieve state-of-the-art unsupervised segmentation of coherent spatiotemporal structures in complex fluid flows."

Architectural specialization is creating new datacenter requirements such as emerging accelerator technologies for machine learning workloads and rack disaggregation strategies will push the limits of current interconnect technologies. Whereas photonic technologies are often sold on the basis of higher bandwidth and energy efficiency (e.g. lower picojoules per bit), these emerging workloads and technology trends will shift the emphasis to other metrics such as bandwidth density (as opposed to bandwidth alone) and reduced latency, and performance consistency. Such metrics cannot be accomplished with device improvements alone, but require a systems view of photonics in datacenters."

      "description": "This work models metropolitan-scale photonic quantum networks that use time bin encoding for quantum key distribution and quantum state teleportation. We develop and validate theoretical models by comparing them with prior experimental results. We use our newly developed simulator of quantum network communication, called SeQUeNCe, to perform simulations at the individual photon level with picosecond resolution. The simulator integrates accurate models of optical components including light sources, interferometers, detectors, beam splitters, and telecommunication fiber, allowing studies of their complex interactions. Optical quantum networks have been generating significant interest because of their ability to provide secure communication, enable new functionality such as clock synchronization with unprecedented accuracy, and reduce the communication complexity of certain distributed computing problems. In the past few years experimental demonstrations moved from table-top experiments to metropolitan-scale deployments and long-distance repeater network prototypes. As the number of optical components in these experiments increases, simulation tools such as SeQUeNCe will simplify experiment planning and accelerate designs of new network protocols. The modular design of our tool will also allow modeling future technologies such as network nodes with quantum memories and quantum transducers as they become available."

      "description": "Optical networks-on-chips (NoCs) based on silicon photonics have been proposed as an emerging communication architecture for many-core chip multiprocessors. However, one of the key challenges is the thermal sensitivity of silicon photonic devices under on-chip temperature variations, which would result in significant thermal-induced optical power loss in optical NoCs. In this work, we propose an approximate Q-routing to find optimal low-loss paths in the presence of on-chip temperature variations. With the method of linear function approximation, the proposed approximate Q-routing does not require Q-tables which are necessary in traditional table-based Q-routing. Simulation results of an 8x8 mesh-based optical NoC under a set of synthetic traffic patterns and real applications show that the proposed approximate Q-routing can converge faster and its optimization effect is very close to the best optimization effect of the traditional table-based Q-routing."

      "description": "Data parallelism is the dominant method used to training deep learning (DL) model on High-Performance Computing systems such as large-scale GPU clusters. In which, collective communication large message, e.g., up to hundreds of MB, between GPUs becomes one of the major bottlenecks. Especially when training a deep learning model on a large number of node, inter-node communication becomes bottle-neck due to its relatively higher latency and lower link bandwidth (than intra-node communication). To cope with this problem, some techniques have been proposed to (a) optimize the collective communication algorithms that take into account the network topology, (b) reduce the message size, and (c) overlap the communication and computation. All of these approaches target to deal with the large message size issue while diminishing the effect of the limitation of the inter-node network. In this study, we investigate the benefit of increasing inter-node link bandwidth by using the hybrid switching systems, i.e., Electrical Packet Switching and Optical Circuit Switching, We find that the typical data-transfer of synchronous data-parallelism training are long-live and rarely changed that can be speed-up with optical switching. Simulation results on Simgrid simulator show that our approach speed-up the training time of deep learning application."

However there is still no commercial uptake and adoption by Cloud and HPC providers. This presentation will delve into why is that and elaborate on the roadblocks, opportunities and choices to address the Moore\u2019s Law slow down and replace electronic switching. It will explain the reasons why optical circuit switching rather than optical packet switching is the best way forward for Data Centers and HPCs and what are the main challenges. PULSE, a scalable network architecture that can reconfigure optical time-slotted circuits in nanoseconds will be introduced to support heterogeneous high performance systems . An insight on technologies we are developing for sub-microsecond network scheduling and sub-nanosecond switching that aim to maximise throughout and minimise latency across thousands of end points (Servers, CPUs, accelerators, memory, etc.) will be provided. Crucially, I\u2019ll present how the network can offer zero data loss, without in-network a) buffering, b) active switching and routing, and c) network header addressing and processing to minimize complexity, and crucially to consume very low power. Furthermore, the system also aims to inherently support 1-to-1, 1-to-N, N-to-N and N-to-1 connectivity in a synchronous manner without the need for data replication for multi/broad -casting, currently not possible. This is key to support diverse workloads such as storage caching, large-scale database lookups, training distributed DNNs, parallel computing that use communication primitives such as allreduce, broadcast and reduce, gather and scatter, all-to-all among others."

RSON connects processor cores, caches, local memories, and remote memories through a novel inter/intra-chip silicon photonic network architecture. We develop a low-latency scalable channel partition and low-power dynamic path priority control scheme for RSON.

The architecture fully exploits optical parallelism of lights using wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) in vector-matrix multiplication. It also exploits a linear optics with passive nanophotonic devices such as microring resonators, optical combiners, and passive couplers, which make it possible to construct low power and ultra-low latency optical neural networks.

Exploiting the maximum available parallelism out of such systems necessitates sophisticated programming approaches that can provide scalable as well as portable solutions without compromising on performance. Software abstraction-based programming models, such as OpenMP and OpenACC, have been raising the abstraction of code to reduce the burden on the programmer while improving productivity. <br><br>Recent architectural trends indicate a heavy reliance of future exascale machines on accelerators for performance. Toward this end, the workshop will highlight the improvements over state-of-art through the accepted papers and prompt discussion through keynotes and panel. The workshop aims to showcase all aspects of heterogeneous systems discussing innovative high-level language features, lessons learned while using directives to migrate scientific legacy code to parallel processors, compilation and runtime scheduling techniques among others."

In addition, all possible tunings for the target architecture were implemented; accordingly, the solver has inferior portability and maintainability.<br><br>In this paper, we apply OpenACC to the solver. The directive-based implementation of OpenACC enables GPU computation to be introduced with a smaller developmental cost even for complex codes. In performance measurements on AI Bridging Cloud Infrastructure (ABCI), we evaluated that a reasonable speedup was attained on GPUs, given that the elapsed time of the entire solver was reduced to 1/14 of that on CPUs based on the original CPU implementation.  Our proposed template to use transprecision computing with our custom FP21 data type is available to the public; therefore, it can provide a successful example for other scientific computing applications."

      "description": "CTBTO is operating and maintaining the international monitoring system of Seismic, Infrasound, Hydroacoustic and Airborne radionuclide to detect a nuclear explosion over the globe. The monitoring network of CTBTO, especially with regard to infrasound and hydroacoustic, is quite unique because the network covers over the globe, and the data is opened to scientific use. CTBTO has been developing and improving the methodologies to analyze observed signals intensively. In this context, hydroacoustic modelling software, especially which that solves the partial differential equation directly, is of interest. As seen in the analysis of the Argentinian submarine accident, the horizontal reflection can play an important role in identifying the location of an underwater event, and as such, accurate modelling software may help analysts find relevant waves efficiently. Thus, CTBTO has been testing a parabolic equation based model (3D-SSFPE) and building a finite difference time domain (FDTD) model. At the same time, using such accurate models require larger computer resources than simplified methods such as ray-tracing. Thus we accelerated them using OpenMP and OpenACC, or the hybrid of those. As a result, in the best case scenarios, (1) 3D-SSFPE was accelerated by approximately 19 times to the original Octave code, employing the GPU-enabled Octfile technology, and (2) FDTD was accelerated by approximately 160 times to the original Fortran code using the OpenMP/OpenACC hybrid technology, on our DGX\u2014Station with V100 GPUs."

      "description": "Achieving high performance and performance portability for large-scale scientific applications is a major challenge on heterogeneous computing systems such as many-core CPUs and accelerators like GPUs. In this work, we implement a widely used block eigensolver, Locally Optimal Block Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient (LOBPCG), using two popular directive based programming models (OpenMP and OpenACC) for GPU-accelerated systems. Our work differs from existing work in that it adopts a holistic approach that optimizes the full solver performance rather than narrowing the problem into small kernels (e.g., SpMM, SpMV). Our LOPBCG GPU implementation achieves a 2.8x - 4.3x speedup over an optimized CPU implementation when tested with four different input matrices. The evaluated configuration compared one Skylake CPU to one Skylake CPU and one NVIDIA V100 GPU. Our OpenMP and OpenACC LOBPCG GPU implementations gave nearly identical performance. We also consider how to create an efficient LOBPCG solver that can solve problems larger than GPU memory capacity. To this end, we create microbenchmarks representing the two dominant kernels (inner product and SpMM kernel) in LOBPCG and then evaluate performance when using two different programming approaches: tiling the kernels, and using Unified Memory with the original kernels. Our tiled SpMM implementation achieves a 2.9x and 48.2x speedup over the Unified Memory implementation on supercomputers with PCIe Gen3 and NVLink 2.0 CPU to GPU interconnects, respectively."

      "description": "The US Department of Energy (DOE) started operating two GPU-based pre-exascale supercomputers in 2018 and plans to deploy another pre-exascale in 2020, and three exascale supercomputers in 2021/2022. All of the systems are GPU-enabled systems, and they plan to provide optimized vendor-promoted programming models for their GPUs such as CUDA, HIP and SYCL. However, due to their limited functional portability, it is challenging for HPC application developers to maintain their applications in an efficient and effective way with good productivity across all US DOE pre-exascale/exascale systems. Directive-based programming models for accelerators can be one of the solutions for HPC applications on the DOE supercomputers. In this study, we employ OpenMP and OpenACC offloading models to port and re-implement the RI-MP2 Fortran kernel of the GAMESS application on a pre-exascale GPU system, Summit. We compare and evaluate the performance of the re-structured offloading kernels with the original OpenMP threading kernel. We also evaluate the performance of multiple math libraries on the Nvidia V100 GPU in the RI-MP2 kernel. Using the optimized directive-based offloading implementations, the RI-MP2 kernel on a single V100 GPU becomes more than 7 times faster than on dual-socket Power9 processors, which is near the theoretical speed-up based on peak performance ratios. MPI + directive-based offloading implementations of the RI-MP2 kernel perform more than 40 times faster than a MPI + OpenMP threading implementation on the same number of Summit nodes. This study demonstrates how directive-based offloading implementations can perform near what we expect based on machine peak ratios."

      "description": "Performance portability is considered to be an inevitable re- quirement in the exascale era. We explore a performance portable ap- proach for fusion plasma turbulence simulation code employing kinetic model, namely GYSELA code. For this purpose, we extract the key features of GYSELA such as high dimensionality and Semi-Lagrangian scheme, and encapsulate them into a mini-application which solves the similar but simplified Vlasov-Poisson system. We implement the mini- app with a mixed OpenACC/OpenMP and Kokkos implementation, where we suppress unnecessary duplications of code lines. For a reference case with the problem size of 128 to the 4, the Skylake (Kokkos), Nvidia Tesla P100 (OpenACC), and P100 (Kokkos) versions achieve an acceleration of 1.45, 12.95, and 17.83, respectively, with respect to the baseline OpenMP version on Intel Skylake. In addition to the performance portability, we discuss the code readability and productivity of each implementation. Based on our experience, Kokkos can offer a readable and productive code at the cost of initial porting efforts, which would be enormous for a large scale simulation code like GYSELA."

      "description": "As computer architectures are rapidly evolving (e.g. those designed for exascale), multiple portability frameworks have been developed to avoid new architecture-specific development and tuning. However, portability frameworks depend on compilers for auto-vectorization and may lack support for explicit vectorization on heterogeneous platforms. Alternatively, programmers can use intrinsics-based primitives to achieve more efficient vectorization, but the lack of a gpu back-end for these primitives makes such code non-portable. A unified, portable, Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) primitive proposed in this work, allows intrinsics-based vectorization on cpus and many-core architectures such as Intel Knights Landing (KNL), and also facilitates Single Instruction Multiple Threads (SIMT) based execution on gpus. This unified primitive, coupled with the Kokkos portability ecosystem, makes it possible to develop explicitly vectorized code, which is portable across heterogeneous platforms. The new SIMD primitive is used on different architectures to test the performance boost against hard-to-auto-vectorize baseline, to measure the overhead against efficiently vectroized baseline, and to evaluate the new feature called the \u201clogical vector length\u201d (LVL). The SIMD primitive provides portability across cpus and gpus without any performance degradation being observed experimentally."

Today's high-performance computing (HPC) developers face a serious dilemma to decide on processor architecture and parallel programming paradigm.<br><br>Software-based abstractions for accelerators give hope to lift this burden but also leave the developers spoilt for choice - from open standards over Domain-specific languages (DSLs) to proprietary approaches, and from open-source to closed-source solutions. The uncertainty surrounding the usability, portability, and interoperability of these abstractions in the future makes it unsettling for the developers. It is but imperative that we try and resolve these shortcomings for their greater adoption.<br><br>This panel hopes to work towards this resolution by bringing together standards committee, supporters, and users of these abstractions, e.g., from OpenACC, OpenMP, Kokkos or SYCL. The panelists will share their insights on the future of these abstractions - Will they converge, diverge, or will there be new approaches that would be needed? What makes a good accelerator programming model? Is there a measure for this \"goodness\"? The audience is also encouraged to challenge the panelists with their questions or share their insights."

      "description": "Despite significant pressure on both Moore\u2019s Law and Dennard scaling, the appetite for ever larger systems continues to grow. Computing trends, in terms of highly optimized hardware platforms that may leverage accelerators or other non-traditional components, scalable and highly performing applications, and the requirements to manage exponentially larger data sets are driving facility demands not envisioned just a few years ago. The facility demands for supercomputing centers (SCs) are characterized by electrical power demands for computing systems that scale to tens of megawatts (MW) and millisecond voltage fluctuations approaching 10MW for the largest systems. The demand for primary electrical distribution capabilities to current large-scale facilities can exceed 60MW.  The operational costs of these facilities must be balanced versus the demand from the systems owners and users for high availability, high utilization, and low-impact facility maintenance and service demands. To achieve this balance, many SCs continue to innovate their operational design practices and technologies. <br><br>The workshop for the Energy Efficient HPC Working Group brings together those concerned with HPC energy efficiency and energy conservation of both HPC systems and facilities. The annual workshop has a broad scope of energy efficiency in HPC ranging from silicon and components, through platform integration, software, and firmware and up to the data center, facility, and connection to the utility provider. Because of this broad scope, we engage a wide spectrum of participants- both facilities and operationally focused people as well as computer engineers and architects- which enhances the discussions and sharing that occurs."

      "description": "Despite significant pressure on both Moore\u2019s Law and Dennard scaling, the appetite for ever larger systems continues to grow. Computing trends, in terms of highly optimized hardware platforms that may leverage accelerators or other non-traditional components, scalable and highly performing applications, and the requirements to manage exponentially larger data sets are driving facility demands not envisioned just a few years ago. The facility demands for supercomputing centers (SCs) are characterized by electrical power demands for computing systems that scale to tens of megawatts (MW) and millisecond voltage fluctuations approaching 10MW for the largest systems. The demand for primary electrical distribution capabilities to current large-scale facilities can exceed 60MW. The operational costs of these facilities must be balanced versus the demand from the systems owners and users for high availability, high utilization, and low-impact facility maintenance and service demands. To achieve this balance, many SCs continue to innovate their operational design practices and technologies.<br><br>The workshop for the Energy Efficient HPC Working Group brings together those concerned with HPC energy efficiency and energy conservation of both HPC systems and facilities. The annual workshop has a broad scope of energy efficiency in HPC ranging from silicon and components, through platform integration, software, and firmware and up to the data center, facility, and connection to the utility provider. Because of this broad scope, we engage a wide spectrum of participants- both facilities and operationally focused people as well as computer engineers and architects- which enhances the discussions and sharing that occurs.<br><br><a href=\"https://eehpcwg.llnl.gov/conf_sc19.html\" target=\"_blank\"> https://eehpcwg.llnl.gov/conf_sc19.html</a>"

      "description": "Useful models of loop kernel runtimes on out-of-order architectures require an analysis of the in-core performance behavior of instructions and their dependencies. While an instruction throughput prediction sets a lower bound to the kernel runtime, the critical path defines an upper bound. Such predictions are an essential part of analytic (i.e., white-box) performance models like the Roofline and Execution-Cache-Memory (ECM) models. They enable  a better understanding of the performance-relevant interactions between hardware architecture and loop code.<br><br>The Open Source Architecture Code Analyzer (OSACA) is a static analysis tool for predicting the execution time of sequential loops. It previously supported only x86 (Intel and AMD) architectures and simple, optimistic full-throughput execution. We have heavily extended OSACA to support ARM instructions and critical path prediction including the detection of loop-carried dependencies, which turns it into a versatile cross-architecture modeling tool. We show runtime predictions for code on Intel Cascade Lake, AMD Zen, and Marvell ThunderX2 micro-architectures based on machine models from available documentation and semi-automatic benchmarking. The predictions are compared with actual measurements."

      "description": "The Roofline performance model provides an intuitive approach to identify performance bottlenecks and guide performance optimization. However, the classic FLOP-centric approach is inappropriate for emerging applications that perform more integer operations than floating-point operations. In this paper, we propose an Instruction Roofline Model on NVIDIA GPUs. The Instruction Roofline incorporates instructions and memory transactions across all memory hierarchies together and provides more performance insights than the FLOP-oriented Roofline Model, i.e., instruction throughput, stride memory access patterns, bank conflicts, and thread predication. We use our Instruction Roofline methodology to analyze five proxy applications: HPGMG from AMReX, BatchSW from merAligner, Matrix Transpose benchmarks, cudaTensorCoreGemm, and cuBLAS. We demonstrate the ability of our methodology to understand various aspects of performance and performance bottlenecks on NVIDIA GPUs and motivate code optimizations."

      "description": "OpenMC is a CPU-based Monte Carlo particle transport simulation code recently developed in the Computa- tional Reactor Physics Group at MIT, and which is currently being evaluated by the UK Atomic Energy Authority for use on the ITER fusion reactor project. In this paper we present a novel port of OpenMC to run on the new ray tracing (RT) cores in NVIDIA\u2019s latest Turing GPUs. We show here that the OpenMC GPU port yields up to 9.8x speedup on a single node over a 16-core CPU using the native constructive solid geometry, and up to 13x speedup using approximate triangle mesh geometry. Furthermore, since the expensive 3D geometric operations re- quired during particle transport simulation can be formulated as a ray tracing problem, there is an opportunity to gain even higher performance on triangle meshes by exploiting the RT cores in Turing GPUs to enable hardware-accelerated ray tracing. Extending the GPU port to support RT core acceleration yields between 2x and 20x additional speedup. We note that geometric model complexity has a significant impact on performance, with RT core acceleration yielding comparatively greater speedups as complexity increases. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work showing that exploitation of RT cores for scientific workloads is possible. We finish by drawing conclusions about RT cores in terms of wider applicability, limitations and performance portability."

      "description": "In Monte Carlo neutron transport simulations, a computational routine commonly known as the \"cross-section lookup\" has been identified as being the most computationally expensive part of these applications. A tool which is commonly used as a proxy application for these routines, named \"XSBench\", was created to simulate popular algorithms used in these routines on CPUs. Currently, however, as GPU-based HPC resources have become more widely available, there has been significant interest and efforts invested in moving these traditionally CPU-based simulations to GPUs. Unfortunately, the algorithms commonly used in the cross-section lookup routine were originally devised and developed for CPU-based platforms, and have seen limited study on GPUs to date. Additionally, platforms such as XSBench implement approximations which may have a negligible effect on CPUs, but may be quite impactful to performance on GPUs given the more resource-limited nature of the latter. As a result, we have created VEXS, a new tool for modeling the cross-section lookup routine which removes or at least reduces the approximations made by XSBench in order to provide a more realistic prediction of algorithm performance on GPUs. In this paper, we detail our efforts to remove and reduce these approximations, show the resulting improvement in performance prediction in comparison to a reference production code, Shift, and provide some basic profiling analysis of the resulting application."

      "description": "One of the major differences in many-core versus multicore architectures is the presence of two different memory spaces: a host space and a device space. In the case of NVIDIA GPUs, the device is supplied with data from the host via one of the multiple memory management API calls provided by the CUDA framework, such as CudaMallocManaged and CudaMemCpy.  Modern systems, such as the Summit supercomputer, have the capability to avoid the use of CUDA calls for memory management and access the same data on GPU and CPU. This is done via the Address Translation Services (ATS) technology that gives a unified virtual address space for data allocated with malloc and new if there is an NVLink connection between the two memory spaces. In this paper, we perform a deep analysis of the performance achieved when using two types of unified virtual memory addressing: UVM and managed memory."

      "description": "HPC system procurement with a fixed budget is an optimization problem with many trade-offs. In particular, the choice of an interconnection network for a system is a major choice, since communication performance is important to overall application performance and the network makes up a substantial fraction of a supercomputer\u2019s overall price. It is necessary to understand how sensitive representative jobs are to various aspects of network performance to procure the right network. Unlike previous studies, which used mostly communication-only motifs or simulation, this work employs a real system and measures the performance of representative applications under controlled environments. We vary background congestion, job mapping, and job placement with different levels of network tapering on a fat tree. Overall, we find that a 2:1 tapered fat tree provides sufficiently robust communication performance for a representative mix of applications while generating meaningful cost savings relative to a full bisection bandwidth fat tree. Furthermore, our results advise against further tapering, as the resulting performance degradation would exceed cost savings. However, application-specific mappings and topology-aware schedulers may reduce global bandwidth needs, providing room for additional network tapering."

Previous work has validated gem5 against ARM platforms. However, gem5 still shows high inaccuracy when modeling Intel\u2019s x86 based processors. In this work, we focus on the simulation of a single node high performance system and study the sources of inaccuracies of gem5. Then we validate gem5 simulator against an Intel processor, Core-i7 (Haswell microarchitecture). We configured gem5 as close as possible to match Core-i7 Haswell microarchitecture configurations and made changes to the simulator to add some features, modified existing code, and tuned built-in configurations. As a result, we validated the simulator by fixing many sources of errors to match real hardware results with less than 6% mean error rate for different control, memory, dependency and execution microbenchmarks."

Quantifying the impact of congestion is essential for effectively assessing and comparing the application runtimes. We use network performance counter-based metrics for this quantification. We claim and demonstrate that by using a local view of congestion captured through the counters monitored during a given application run, we can accurately determine the run conditions and thereby estimate the impact on the application's performance. We construct a predictive model that is trained using several applications with distinctive communication characteristics run under production system conditions with a 91% accuracy for predicting congestion effects."

Understanding the behavior of massively threaded GPU programs can be difficult, even though recent GPUs provide an abundance of hardware performance counters, which collect statistics about certain events.  Profiling tools that assist the user in such analysis for their GPUs, like NVIDIA's nvprof and cupti, are state-of-the-art.  However, instrumentation based on reading hardware performance counters can be slow, in particular when the number of metrics is large. Furthermore, the results can be inaccurate as instructions are grouped to match the available set of hardware counters."

      "description": "Unified Memory (UM) has significantly simplified the task of programming CUDA applications. With UM, the CUDA driver is responsible for managing the data movement between CPU and GPU and the programmer can focus on the actual designs. However, the performance of Unified Memory codes has not been on par with explicit device buffer based code. To this end, the latest NVIDIA Pascal and Volta GPUs with hardware support such as fine-grained page faults offer the best of both worlds, i.e., high-productivity and high-performance.  However, these enhancements in the newer generation GPU architectures need to be evaluated in a different manner, especially in the context of MPI+CUDA applications.  <br><br>In this paper, we extend the widely used MPI benchmark \u2014 OSU Micro-benchmarks (OMB) to support Unified Memory or Managed Memory based MPI benchmarks. The current version of OMB cannot effectively characterize UM-Aware MPI design because CUDA driver movements are not captured appropriately with standardized Host and Device buffer based benchmarks.  To address this key challenge, we propose new designs for the OMB suite and extend point to point and collective benchmarks that exploit sender and receiver side CUDA kernels to emulate the effective location of the UM buffer on Host and Device.  The new benchmarks allow the users to better understand the performance of codes with UM buffers through user-selectable knobs that enable or disable sender and receiver side CUDA kernels. In addition to the design and implementation, we provide a comprehensive performance evaluation of the new UM benchmarks in the OMB-UM suite on a wide variety of systems and MPI libraries. From these evaluations we also provide valuable insights on the performance of various MPI libraries on UM buffers which can lead to further improvement in the performance of UM in CUDA-Aware MPI libraries."

We recognize that the coverage of the term 'performance' has broadened to include power consumption and reliability, and that performance modeling is practiced through analytical methods and approaches based on software tools and simulators.<br><br>Performance modeling, benchmarking, and simulation will underpin software and hardware design choices as we advance towards the exascale era. This workshop continues to attract high quality input from industry, government, and academia.<br><br><a href=\"http://www.pmbsworkshop.org\" target=\"_blank\"> http://www.pmbsworkshop.org</a>"

      "description": "Large-scale numerical simulations, observations, and experiments are generating very large datasets that are difficult to analyze, store, and transfer. Data compression is an attractive and efficient technique to significantly reduce the size of scientific datasets. This tutorial reviews the state of the art in lossy compression of scientific datasets, discusses in detail two lossy compressors (SZ and ZFP), introduces compression error assessment metrics and the Z-checker tool to analyze the difference between initial and decompressed datasets. The tutorial addresses the following questions: Why lossless and lossy compression? How does compression work? How to measure and control compression error? The tutorial uses examples of real-world compressors and scientific datasets to illustrate the different compression techniques and their performance. Participants will also have the opportunity to learn how to use SZ, ZFP and Z-checker for their own datasets. The tutorial is given by two of the leading teams in this domain and targets primarily beginners interested in learning about lossy compression for scientific data. This half-day tutorial is improved from the evaluations of the highly rated tutorials given on this topic at ISC17, SC17 and SC18."

      "description": "The Roofline performance model offers an insightful and intuitive method for extracting the key execution characteristics of HPC applications and comparing them against the performance \u00adbounds of modern CPUs and GPUs. Its capability to abstract the complexity of memory hierarchies and identify the most profitable optimization techniques have made Roofline\u00ad-based analysis increasingly popular in the HPC community. Although different flavors of the Roofline model have been developed to deal with various definitions of memory data movement, there remains a need for a systematic methodology when applying them to analyze the efficiency of applications running on multicore, many\u00adcore, and accelerated systems. <br><br>The tutorial aims to bridge this gap on both CPUs and GPUs by exposing the fundamental aspects behind different Roofline modeling principles and providing several practical use\u00ad case scenarios to highlight their efficacy for application optimization. This tutorial presents a unique and solid combination of novel methodologies applied to optimize a representative set of open science use cases, while practice\u00ad-oriented, hands-on topics and labs are given by the lead methodology researchers and the main designer of Intel\u2019s Roofline automation tools. The tutorial presenters have a long history of working with the Roofline model and have presented several Roofline-\u00adbased tutorials."

      "description": "Continued advancement in computational power and high-speed networking is enabling a new model of scientific experiment, experiment-in-the-loop computing (EILC).  In this model, one or more high-fidelity simulations are run as data is collected from observational and experimental sources.  At the same time, the amount and complexity of data generated by simulations and by observational and experimental sources, such as distributed sensor networks and large-scale scientific user facilities, continues to increase. Several research and development challenges are posed by this paradigm, many of which are independent of the scientific application domain.  New algorithms, including artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms, to merge simulation ensembles and experimental data sets must be developed.  High performance data management and transfer techniques must be developed to control the ensembles and move simulated and observed data sets.

      "description": "Natural sciences are increasingly reliant on large volumes of experimental data obtained from highly-automated scientific equipment to drive scientific discovery. While the instrumentation available to the scientific community enables individual researchers to acquire experimental data at spectacular rates, the decision making and experimental design process of the measurements is still largely driven by the individual researcher operating the instrument.   <br>In recent years, some scientific areas, like X-Ray scattering and synchrotron infra-red microscopy, have started to shift towards autonomously executed experimentation, using tools from Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. <br>Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) is a popular technique that enables the construction of a surrogate model required to drive an experiment in an autonomous fashion. GPRs have been successfully implemented at synchrotron radiation beam lines at the Advanced Light Source (ALS) and the National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS-II). <br>Given that a single measurement on state-of-the-art synchrotron equipment can be acquired in a fraction of a second, being able to obtain feedback at a similar time scale is essential. Traditionally, specific tasks in GPR, such as hyper-parameter tuning and covariance estimation, are compute-intensive, limiting the utility of GPR as an appropriate tool when near real-time feedback is an absolute necessity. In this paper we discuss, present and review computational strategies that allow the numerical acceleration of Gaussian Process analyses within a framework of autonomous sequential experiments. The results show that significant time savings can be achieved by taking advantage of a number of some rather well-established mathematical and computational approaches."

      "description": "The use of deep learning models within scientific experimental facilities frequently requires low-latency inference, so that, for example, quality control operations can be performed while data are being collected. Edge computing devices can be useful in this context, as their low cost and compact form factor permit them to be co-located with the experimental apparatus.<br>Can such devices, with their limited resources, can perform neural network feed-forward computations efficiently and effectively? We explore this question by evaluating the performance and accuracy of a scientific image restoration model, for which both model input and output are images, on edge computing devices. Specifically, we evaluate deployments of TomoGAN, an image-denoising model based on generative adversarial networks developed for low-dose x-ray imaging, on the Google Edge TPU and NVIDIA Jetson. We adapt TomoGAN for edge execution, evaluate model inference performance, and propose methods to address the accuracy drop caused by model quantization. We show that these edge computing devices can deliver accuracy comparable to that of a full-fledged CPU or GPU <br>model, at speeds that are more than adequate for use in the intended deployments,<br>denoising a 1024x1024 image in less than a second. <br>Our experiments also show that the Edge TPU models can provide 3x faster inference response than a CPU-based model and 1.5x faster than an edge GPU-based model.<br>This combination of high speed and low cost permits image restoration anywhere."

In this document, we explore different design options to support sparse data in HDF5, one of the most popular high-performance I/O libraries and file formats used for scientific data. We discuss several use cases and requirements. Our main hard design constraint is that any changes to the HDF5 dataset API would be a burden on users and not acceptable. The remaining options are discussed below. We provide a rationale for what we believe is the strongest candidate and describe how its potential benefits can be simulated with the existing HDF5 library. We have conducted a set of computational experiments the results of which are reported here. They show that our candidate meets all relevant requirements and gives us a certain degree of confidence for an HDF5 library-native implementation."

      "description": "The increase in velocity, volume, and complexity of the data generated by the upcoming LCLS-II upgrade presents a considerable challenge for data acquisition, data processing, and data management.  These systems face formidable challenges due to the extremely high data throughput, hundreds of GB/s to multi-TB/s, generated by the detectors at the experimental facilities and to the intensive computational demand for data processing and scientific interpretation.  The LCLS-II Data System offers a fast, powerful, and flexible architecture that includes a feature extraction layer designed to reduce the data volumes by at least one order of magnitude while preserving the science content of the data. Innovative architectures are required to implement this reduction with a configurable approach that can adapt to the multiple science areas served by LCLS.  In order to increase the likelihood of experiment success and improve the quality of recorded data, a real-time analysis framework provides visualization and graphically-configurable analysis of a selectable subset of the data on the timescale of seconds. A fast feedback layer offers dedicated processing resources to the running experiment in order to provide experimenters feedback about the quality of acquired data within minutes.  We will present an overview of the LCLS-II Data System architecture with an emphasis on the Data Reduction Pipeline (DRP) and online monitoring framework."

In this model, one or more high-fidelity simulations are run as data is collected from observational and experimental sources. At the same time, the amount and complexity of data generated by simulations and by observational and experimental sources, such as distributed sensor networks and large-scale scientific user facilities, continues to increase. Several research and development challenges are posed by this paradigm, many of which are independent of the scientific application domain. New algorithms, including artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms, to merge simulation ensembles and experimental data sets must be developed. High performance data management and transfer techniques must be developed to control the ensembles and move simulated and observed data sets. Workflows must be constructed with high-quality provenance metadata to enable post-analysis and improvement of the computing solution.

      "description": "Linux Containers with the build-once run-anywhere principle have gained huge attention in the research community where portability and reproducibility are key concerns. Unlike virtual machines (VMs), containers run the underlying host OS kernel. The container filesystem can include all necessary non-default prerequisites to run the container application at unaltered performance. For this reason, containers are popular in HPC for use with parallel/MPI applications. Some use cases include also abstraction layers, e.g. MPI applications require matching of MPI version between the host and the container, and/or GPU applications require the underlying GPU drivers to be installed within the container filesystem. In short, containers can only abstract what is above the OS kernel, not below. Consequently, portability is not completely granted. <br>This paper presents the experience of PRACE (Partnership for Advanced Computer in Europe) in supporting Singularity containers on HPC clusters and provides notes about possible approaches for deploying MPI applications using different use cases. <br>Performance comparison between bare metal and container executions are also provided, showing a negligible overhead in the container execution."

Moreover, containers are known to package and deploy applications consistently across varying infrastructures. Container orchestrators manage a large number of containers for microservices based cloud applications. <br>However, the use of such service orchestration frameworks towards HPC workloads remains relatively unexplored.<br><br>In this paper we study the potential use of Kubernetes on HPC infrastructure for use by the scientific community.  We directly compare both its features and performance against Docker Swarm and bare metal execution of HPC applications. Herein, we detail the configurations required for Kubernetes to operate with containerized MPI applications, specifically accounting for operations such as (1) underlying device access, (2)  inter-container communication across different hosts, and (3) configuration limitations.<br>This evaluation quantifies the performance difference between representative MPI workloads running both on bare metal and containerized orchestration frameworks with Kubernetes, operating over both Ethernet and InfiniBand interconnects. Our results show that Kubernetes and Docker Swarm can achieve near bare metal performance over RDMA communication when high performance transports are enabled. Our results also show that Kubernetes presents overheads for several HPC applications over TCP/IP protocol. However, Docker Swarm's throughput is near bare metal performance for the same applications."

Containers, which use Linux kernel features to allow a user to substitute their own software stack for that installed on the host, are an increasingly popular method to provide this flexibility. Because standard container technologies such as Docker are unsuitable for HPC, three HPC-specific technologies have emerged: Charliecloud, Shifter, and Singularity.<br><br>A common concern is that containers may introduce performance overhead. To our knowledge, no comprehensive, rigorous, HPC-focused assessment of container performance has previously been performed.

      "description": "Graph algorithms are at the core of data-intensive applications. As such, efficient graph processing is of great importance.  Irregularity in real-world graphs can make performance unpredictable and non-portable across different inputs and architectures. Given a type of graph, the same optimized implementation of an algorithm can produce performance numbers that differ by orders-of-magnitude. We conduct extensive analysis on a set of 1238 graphs to identify input-sensitive performance inefficiencies, including two that have not been studied: (i) register pressure and (ii) CPU-GPU data movement via demand paging. We then build a multiclass decision tree classifier that characterizes the irregular properties of graphs from our data and maps them to an optimal control parameterization at the compiler, system and algorithmic layers, that yield the highest overall algorithmic performance. We then integrate the classifier into a system where it will process a new graph and generate a kernel on the predicted optimal configuration."

      "description": "As the core counts of computing platforms continue to rise, parallel runtime systems with support for very fine-grained tasks become increasingly necessary to fully utilize the available resources. A critical feature of such task-based parallel runtime systems is the ability to balance work evenly and quickly across available cores. We highlight this by studying XTask, a custom parallel runtime system based on XQueue, which is a novel lock-less concurrent queuing system with relaxed ordering semantics that is geared to realizing scalability to hundreds of concurrent threads. We demonstrate the lack of adequate load balancing in the original XQueue design and present several solutions for improving load balancing. We also evaluate the corresponding improvements in performance on two sample workloads, computation of Fibonacci numbers and computation of Cholesky factorization. Finally, we compare the performance of several versions of XTask along with several implementations of the popular OpenMP runtime system."

      "description": "Per-node memory capacity limits the maximal problem size of HPC applications. Na\u00efve data compression alleviates the memory impact, but requires full decompression before the data is accessed. ZFP compressed arrays reduce the memory footprint, by independently compressing data in fixed sized blocks. Thus, decompressing individual blocks and caching them enables random access and a reduction in decompressions on the critical path. The performance of ZFP compressed arrays is dependent on several key variables: software cache size, cache policy, and compression rate. In this poster, we explore the sensitivity of these ZFP parameters on runtime performance for the matrix-matrix multiplication algorithm. Results show that selection of cache size, policy, and rate yields 8% performance improvement over the default ZFP configuration."

This algorithm is called dominator detection and holds a wide range of applications, such as compiler design, circuit testing, and social network analysis. While the performance of many other graph algorithms soars with respect to the increase of the hardware parallelism, dominator detection algorithm experiences very little advancement due to the hardship of parallelism. This work thus introduces an efficient parallel dominator detection algorithm that is inspired by Breadth-First Search (BFS), which bests SEMI-NCA on large graphs."

As the driving application, we primarily use computational relativity where computations of Einstein equations become complicated due to the presence of curvature in spacetime. <br><br>The presented framework is based on SymPy with additional modules written to handle complicated partial differential equations (PDEs). The symbolically written equations are converted to a computational graph, which enables to perform architecture (cache, register optimizations) and language specific (SIMD vectorization, CUDA) optimizations.

As a basis for noise mitigation, we develop a convolutional neural network noise model to estimate the difference in noise between a given pair of equivalent quantum circuits. On a classically simulated dataset of 1.6 million pairs of quantum circuits with a simplified noise model calibrated to IBM Q hardware, the deep learning approach shows a significant improvement in noise prediction over linear gate count models. A greedy peephole optimization procedure is proposed to minimize noise using the deep learning model as an objective function, showing further improvement in noise mitigation compared to commonly used gate count minimization heuristics."

We evaluate these predictions on the basis of what makes a useful prefetch in our context for the GPU.

However, this poster has identified some critical limitations of current-generation EC NIC offload schemes on modern SmartNICs and the missing of exploiting heterogeneous hardware available on modern HPC clusters in parallel. To address these limitations, this poster first proposes a unified benchmark suite to benchmark, measure and characterize hardware-optimized erasure coders. Then, it proposes a Multi-Rail EC concept which enables upper-layer applications to leverage heterogeneous hardware to perform EC operations simultaneously. Finally, it proposes a new EC NIC offload paradigm based on the tripartite graph model, namely TriEC. TriEC supports both encode-and-send and receive-and-decode offload primitives efficiently."

The key contribution is a generic technique called \u2206-screening, which examines the most recent batch of changes made to an input graph and selects a subset of vertices to reevaluate for potential community (re)assignment. This technique can be incorporated into any of the community detection methods that use modularity as its objective function for clustering.

Our experiments demonstrate that our approach is able to generate performance speedups without compromising on the output quality."

These networks, whose diameters grow linearly as their sizes grow exponentially, are generated by using the Cartesian products of smaller optimal networks of minimum diameters. For the smaller base networks, we design the vertex-balanced routing algorithm by considering the forwarding pressure at each vertex. Comparative benchmarks on a Beowulf cluster show significant improvement in performance after using the new routing algorithm. Each node of the new network generated from base graphs with low-diameter can also sustain balanced forwarding loadings if we apply optimal routing algorithms to the base network. Simulation results for larger networks show that the optimal routing algorithms achieve the gain of communication performance."

      "description": "Performance modeling is a well-known technique for understanding the scaling behavior of an application.  Although the modeling process is today often automatic, it still relies on a domain expert selecting program parameters and deciding relevant sampling intervals. Since existing empirical methods attempt blackbox modeling, the decision on which parameters influence a selected part of the program is based on measured data, making empirical modeling sensitive to human errors and instrumentation noise. We introduce a hybrid analysis to mitigate the current limitations of empirical modeling, combining the confidence of static analysis with the ability of dynamic taint analysis to capture the effects of control-flow and memory operations. We construct models of computation and communication volumes that help the modeler to remove effects of noise and improve the correctness of estimated models. Our automatic analysis prunes irrelevant program parameters and brings an understanding of parameter dependencies which helps in designing the experiment."

As such systems become more and more powerful, they are exploited by attackers to run malicious and for-profit programs that typically require extremely high computing ability to be successful. Our classification framework leverages the distinctive signatures between illicit and authorized workloads, and explore machine learning methods to learn the workloads and classify them. The framework uses lightweight, non-intrusive workload profiling to collect model input data, and explores multiple machine learning methods, particularly recurrent neural network (RNN) that is suitable for online anomalous workload detection. Evaluation results on four generations of GPU machines demonstrate that the workload classification framework can tell apart the illicit authorized workloads with high accuracy of over 95%.    The collected dataset, detection framework, and neural network models will be made available on GitHub."

Unfortunately porting or writing an application for accelerators, such as GPUs, requires extensive knowledge of the underlying architectures, the application/algorithm and the interfacing programming model (e.g. OpenMP). Often applications spend a significant portion of their execution time on data transfer. Exploiting data reuse opportunities in an application can reduce its overall execution time. In this research, we present an approach to automatically recognize data reuse opportunities in an application which uses OpenMP for exploiting GPU parallelism, and consequently insert pertinent code to take advantage of data reuse on GPU. Using our approach we were able to retain reused data on the GPU and reduce the overall execution time of multiple benchmark application."

HPC job scheduler plays a crucial role in efficient use of resources. However, traditional job schedulers are single-objective and fail to efficient use of other resources. In our previous work, we present a job scheduling framework named BBSched to schedule CPUs and burst buffers. As we are heading toward exascale computing, a variety of heterogeneous resources are deployed in HPC systems. In this poster, we extend BBSched for managing multiple resources beyond CPUs and burst buffers. We formulate multi-resource scheduling as a general multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem, present a heuristic method to solve the NP-hard MOO problem, and provide a preliminary evaluation for scheduling up to ten resources. The proposed multi-resource scheduling design is intended to enhance Cobalt, a production job scheduler deployed on HPC systems at Argonne Leadership Computing Facility (ALCF)."

The fundamental goals of this challenge are to minimize the cloudlet deployment cost and to guarantee minimum latency to the users of edge services. We address this challenge by designing a cost-aware cloudlet placement approach that that ensures user latency requirements while covering all devices in the service region. We first mathematically formulate the problem as a  multi-objective integer programming model in a general deployment scenario, which is computationally NP-hard. We then propose a genetic algorithm-based approach, GACP, to find heuristic solutions in significantly reduced time. We investigate the effectiveness of GACP by performing extensive experiments on multiple deployment scenarios based on New York City OpenData. The results presented in the poster show that our approach obtains close to optimal cost solutions with significant time reduction."

We tackle a complicating factor that is arising in seismic inversion problems: the addition of waves injected from sources distributed sparsely over the 2D/3D domain, and the need for receivers that interpolate data measurements at a set of points, again distributed sparsely across the domain.  In this work we show how to overcome this limitation. We introduce an algorithm for a loop nest transformation policy applied to wave propagation in order to improve data locality and optimize our cache memory use. Our algorithm uses an inspector/executor scheme capable of inspecting measurement operations at sparse locations and then compute the field updates. The ultimate goal of this ongoing work is to automate this scheme for stencil codes generated by Devito."

With higher memory density, we can run scientific computing applications with larger problem sizes on fewer compute nodes than on current HPC systems. Smaller HPC clusters will reduce the cost of running scientific simulations.

Our contribution is three-fold: (a) the design of a computational framework to compare automated fiber detection models with curated datasets through classification; (b) lossless data reduction by embedding prior knowledge into data-driven models; (c) a scheme to decompose computation into embarrassingly parallel processes for future analysis at scale. Our results show how FibCAM classifies different structures, and how it illustrates the material's composition and frequency distribution of microstructures for improved interpretability of machine learning models.

With the CUDA and the hardware support of the Volta GPUs on Sierra, the existing kernels should be further optimized to fully take the advantage of the new hardware, and the optimizations have shown significant performance improvement. The presented kernels have been put in HYPRE for solving large scale linear systems on HPC equipped with GPUs.

      "description": "The lack of low-overhead and scalable monitoring tools have prevented a comprehensive study of efficiency and utilization of emerging NVLink-enabled GPU clusters. We address this by proposing and designing an in-depth, real-time analysis, profiling, and visualization tool for high-performance GPU-enabled clusters with NVLinks on the top of the OSU INAM. The proposed tool is capable of presenting a unified and holistic view of MPI-level and fabric level information for emerging NVLink-enabled high-performance GPU clusters. It also provides insights into the efficiency and utilization of underlying interconnects for different communication patterns.  We also designed a low overhead and scalable modules to discover the fabric topology and gather fabric metrics by using different levels of threading, bulk insertions and deletions for storage, and using parallel components for fabric discovery and port metric inquiry."

      "description": "High-Performance Computing systems must  simultaneously address both resilience and power. In heterogeneous systems, the trade-offs between resilience and energy-efficiency are more complex for applications using both CPUs and GPUs.  A deep understanding of the interplay among energy efficiency, resilience, and performance is required for heterogeneous systems to address them simultaneously.<br><br>In this work, we present a new framework for resilient and energy-efficient computing in GPU-accelerated systems. This framework supports partial or full redundancy and checkpointing for resilience, and provides users with flexible hardware resource selection, adjustable precision and power management to improve performance and energy-efficiency. We further perform CUDA-aware MPI to reduce resilience overhead, mainly in message communication between GPUs.  Using CG as an example, we show that our framework provides about 40% time and 45% energy savings, comparing to simple extension of RedMPI, a redundancy based resilience framework for homogeneous CPU systems."

      "description": "In this work, we propose smart data transfer (SDT) along with extensions to metadirective and map constructs in OpenMP 5.0 to improve adaptive computing. The Smith-Waterman algorithm is used as an example, whose na\u00efve implementation does not conduct data transfer efficiently. SDT is used to solve this issue with the following advantages: (1) SDT only transfers necessary data to GPU instead of the whole data set, resulting in 4.5x of speedup in our initial experiments. (2) Depending on computing vs. data transfer requirements of a program, SDT will transfer the output of each iteration from GPU to host either immediately or all together after the last GPU kernel call. (3) It supports large data exceeding GPU device memory's size via data tiling. We propose to extend metadirective's context selector to obtain similar improvement by enabling target enter/exit data and on-demand data access."

      "description": "As HPC applications migrate from the petascale systems of today to the exascale systems of tomorrow, the increasing need to embrace asynchronous, irregular, and dynamic communication patterns will lead to a corresponding decrease in application-level determinism. Two critical challenges emerge from this trend. First, unchecked non-determinism coupled with the non-associativity of floating-point arithmetic undermines numerical reproducibility of scientific applications. Second, the prevalence of non-determinism amplifies the cost of debugging, both in terms of computing resources and human effort. In this thesis, we present a modeling methodology to quantify and characterize communication non-determinism in parallel applications. Our methodology consists of three core components. First, we build graph-structured models of relevant communication events from execution traces. Second, we apply similarity metrics based on graph kernels to quantify run-to-run variability and thus identify the regions of executions where non-determinism manifests most prominently. Third, we leverage our notion of execution similarity to characterize applications via clustering, anomaly detection, and extraction of representative patterns of non-deterministic communication which we dub \"non-determinism motifs\". Our work will amplify the effectiveness of software tools that target mitigation or control of application-level non-determinism (e.g., record-and-replay tools) by providing them with a common metric for quantifying communication non-determinism in parallel applications and a common language for describing it."

      "description": "My research focuses on developing a pipeline optimization infrastructure that automates the design and code generation of neural networks through the use of high-performance computing. The problem has the following objectives: unify automated machine learning (AutoML) and compilation, archive profiles for creation of a knowledge base for a data-driven approach toward search, explore various search optimizations for model design and code generation. The field of automated deep learning includes hyperparameter optimization and neural architecture search (NAS), which requires domain expertise in designing a model, in addition to the tuning parameters related to learning and the model itself. The search space is complex and deciding which parameters factor into the overall accuracy of a model is a non-trivial task. Once a model is trained, the next step compiles the model, which maps to the backend of a targeted architecture, whether GPU, embedded mobile phones, or FPGA. The compilation phase also involves choices, in terms of optimizations applied, which can include a set of flags, or direct code transformations. Various efficient search techniques are explored, archiving results along the way for facilitating in code generation options, which could possibly inform the model design process. Our previous work reduced the search space for code generation of various domain kernels by 92%, and this work investigates whether the same approach can be applied in all aspects of AutoML design and code generation."

      "description": "Devito is a domain-specific language for the automatic generation of high-performance solvers for finite difference equations provided in a high-level symbolic representation. The primary use of Devito is to enable Full-waveform inversion, which is an adjoint-based optimization problem that uses the wave equation as part of its objective function. This doctoral project consists of three elements of Devito that are key to solving adjoint-based optimization problems (i.e. the back propagation). The first is automatic differentiation of stencil loops. This allows the automatic generation of high-performance code implementing the derivative of any provided function. This is essential to enable the use of a wider range of physical equations - in order to use better physical approximations. An essential feature of the generated derivatives is that they show scaling and performance behaviour that is very similar to the forward function. A common issue in solving adjoint-based optimization problems is the prohibitively high memory requirement. The second contribution is a runtime for automatic execution of checkpoint-recompute schedules (called pyRevolve) to alleviate this memory requirement by trading it off for re-computations. These schedules may involve storing some intermediate states on disk, some in memory, and recomputing others. The third contribution is the use of lossy compression (ZFP/SZ), which is a second means of trading off memory and compute, automatically as part of checkpointing in pyRevolve. This is the first time it has been shown that lossy compression combined with checkpoint-recomputation can provide a much better error-memory tradeoff than using checkpoint-recomputation or lossy compression alone."

      "description": "Many emerging non-invasive medical procedures such as high intensity focused ultrasound treatment (HIFU), photoacoustic imaging, or transcranial ultrasound therapy require ultrasound wave propagation simulations. Typically soft tissue can be modeled as fluid, weakly heterogeneous medium with frequency dependent absorption and non-linear effects at high ultrasound intensities. The k-Wave acoustic toolbox, widely used in medical community, uses highly efficient k-space pseudo-spectral time-domain (KSTD) discretization of acoustic equations to solve these problems. However, it is difficult to efficiently map the KSTD method onto modern cluster architectures with accelerators such as GPUs. The present thesis analyzes shortcomings of the KSTD method in respect to modern clusters and proposes local Fourier basis approach to improve scaling of the method. It is shown that the proposed method is able to achieve 5x speedup, while having sufficient accuracy for these medical applications. Behavior of the method is analyzed across variety of GPU and MIC (Intel Xeon Phi) accelerated clusters and results are presented."

      "description": "Pattern matching is a computation that maps naturally onto finite automata (FA) abstractions. There has been a substantial amount of work on accelerating FA processing on various parallel platforms. However, the advantages and disadvantages of different automata processing accelerators and the innovation space in this area are still unclear. We target this problem and propose a compiler tool-chain that automates the deployment of non-deterministic finite automata (NFAs) onto different target platforms. Using this toolchain, we perform an apples-to-apples comparison between AP, GPU- and FPGA-based NFA accelerator designs on large-scale datasets. Specifically, we observe that memory-based designs are limited by memory size and bandwidth. To address this issue, we target fixed-topology NFAs and propose a memory-efficient design that embeds the automata topology in code and stores only the transition symbols in memory. Our solution is suitable for SIMD architectures and is called SIMD_NFA. We design a compiler that automates the deployment of this design on SIMD platforms. We showcase our compiler framework on GPU and Intel platforms. Additionally, we observe that for NFAs with a grid-like fixed-topology (e.g., NFAs for Levenshtein and Hamming distance-based matching), transitions do not need to be encoded within the traversal code but can be inferred from the reference string to be matched and the knowledge of the NFA topology. Lastly, SIMD_NFA is a good fit for FPGA deployment using OpenCL-to-FPGA toolchains. We investigate the deployment of the OpenCL version of SIMD_NFA, on FPGA and explore a set of optimizations techniques to retarget SIMD_NFA to FPGA."

      "description": "In the scope of technical and scientific computing, the rush toward larger simulations has been so far assisted by a steady downsizing of micro-processing units, which has allowed to increase the compute capacity of general-purpose architectures at constant power. As side effects of the end of Dennard's scaling, this process is now hitting its ultimate power limits and is just about to come to an end. This implies an increase in the energy cost for computation, performance loss due to a design based on worst-case power consumption, and performance loss due to overheating, and thermal gradients. As result, thermal and power bound supercomputing machines show performance degradation and heterogeneity which limit the peak performance of the system. This doctoral showcase presents software strategies to tackle the main bottlenecks induced by power and thermal issues that affect next-generation supercomputers. To respond to the above challenges, my work shows that propagating workload requirements from application to the runtime and operating system levels is the key to provide efficiency. This is possible only if the proposed software methodologies cause little or no overhead in term of application performance. With this in mind in my work, I have designed application-aware node-level optimal thermal management algorithms and runtimes, lazy node-level power capping, and energy reduction runtime. The experimental results show a significant step forward with respect to the current state-of-the-art solutions in power and thermal control of HPC systems."

      "description": "Recent advances in Machine/Deep Learning techniques have triggered key success stories in many application domains like Computer Vision, Speech Comprehension and Recognition, and Natural Language Processing. Large-scale Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), that are at the core of state-of-the-art AI technologies, have been the primary drivers of this success. Training very complicated and large DNN architectures using a large number of training examples (data) is compute-intensive and can take from weeks to months to achieve state-of-the-art prediction capabilities. To achieve higher accuracy, making the DNN deeper is also a common strategy. These requirements have led to a simple but powerful approach called Data Parallelism to achieve shorter training times. This has resulted in various research studies and ML/DL software like TensorFlow and PyTorch as well as distributed-training middleware like Horovod. In addition, for DNNs that do not fit the GPU memory, a new DNN workloads are emerging that we call Out-of-Core DNNs and different strategies (out-of-core training and model-parallelism) are needed to train them. Clearly, large-scale DNN training brings forward new requirements for computation runtimes like CUDA and communication middleware like the MVAPICH2 MPI library. In this thesis, we broadly explore three different strategies to train DNNs on modern CPU and GPU architectures: 1) Data Parallelism, 2) Model Parallelism, and 3) Out-of-Core Training. We address the key challenge: How to co-design computation and communication in modern ML/DL frameworks with execution runtimes like CUDA and communication middleware like MVAPICH2 to enable scalable, high-performance, and efficient training of DNNs on large-scale HPC systems?"

      "description": "This thesis presents an approach to performance, portability, and productivity for data-parallel computations on multi- and many-core architectures, e.g., Intel CPU and NVIDIA GPU. We introduce the algebraic formalism of Multi-Dimensional Homomorphisms (MDHs) \u2013 a class of functions that cover important data-parallel computations, e.g., linear algebra routines (BLAS) and stencil computations. For our MDHs, we propose a Domain-Specific Language (DSL), based on patterns of parallelism (a.k.a. algorithmic skeletons), to enable conveniently expressing MDH functions. We introduce a code generation approach for our DSL to automatically generate for MDHs optimized program code targeting multi- and many-core architectures. Our code generation approach relies on OpenCL \u2013 an emerging de-facto standard for uniformly programming parallel architectures, such as CPU and GPU. A major feature of our generated code is that it is targeted to OpenCL\u2019s abstract device models (rather than a particular architecture) by being parameterized in performance-critical parameters of these abstract models (e.g., the number of threads and size of tiles). With our code generation approach, we enable both high performance and performance portability: we fully automatically optimize our generated code -- for any given combination of an MDH function, architecture, and input size -- by automatically choosing (auto-tuning) optimized values of our code\u2019s performance-critical parameters using our own Auto-Tuning Framework (ATF). Our experimental results on CPU and GPU demonstrate competitive and often significantly better performance of our MDH+ATF approach as compared to the currently best-performing competitors, e.g., Intel MKL/MKL-DNN, NVIDIA cuBLAS/cuDNN, and Facebook\u2019s Tensor Comprehensions framework."

      "description": "As high-performance computing systems scale in size and computational power, the occurrence of transient faults grows. Without protection by efficient and effective fault tolerance mechanisms, transient errors can cause incorrect execution outcome and even lead to a catastrophe in safety-critical HPC applications. Previous work attributes error resilience in HPC applications at a high-level to either the probabilistic or iterative nature of the application, whereas the community still lacks the fundamental understanding of the program constructs that result in natural error resilience. We design FlipTracker, a framework to analytically track error propagation and to provide a fine-grained understanding of the propagation and tolerance of errors. After running FlipTracker on representative HPC applications, we summarize six resilience computation patterns that lead to nature error resilience in HPC applications. With a better understanding of natural resilience in HPC applications, we aim to model application resilience on data objects to transient faults. Many common application-level fault tolerance mechanisms focus on data objects. Understanding application resilience on data objects can be helpful to direct those mechanisms. The common practice to understand application resilience (random fault injection) gives us little knowledge of how and where errors are tolerated. Understanding \"how\" and \"where\" is necessary to understand how to apply application-level fault tolerance mechanisms effectively and efficiently. We design a practical model (MOARD) to measure application resilience on data objects by analytically quantifying error masking events happening to the data object. Using our model, users can compare application resilience on different data objects with different data types."

      "description": "In the era of post Moore's law, the traditional CPU is not able to keep the pace up and provide the computing power demanded by the modern compute-intensive and highly parallelizable applications. Under this context, various accelerator architectures such as general-purpose graphics processing unit (GPU), which equipped with the high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and massive parallelizable streaming multiprocessors, has been widely adopted in high-performance computing (HPC) and cloud systems to significantly accelerate numerous scientific and emerging machine/deep learning applications. Message Passing Interface (MPI), the standard programming model for parallel applications, has been widely used for GPU communication. However, the state-of-the-art MPI libraries are only optimizing GPU communication by leveraging advanced technology like Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) and not fully utilizing the computational power of GPUs. In this work, we propose GPU-enabled communication schemes to harness GPU computational resources, and cutting-edge interconnects such as NVIDIA NVLink for communication operations on the emerging heterogeneous systems. In this work, three primary MPI operations are addressed. First, intelligent communication scheduling, efficient packing/unpacking, and packing-free schemes are proposed to accelerate non-contiguous data transfer in scientific HPC applications. Second, scalable broadcast operations are presented to leverage the low-level hardware multicast feature to speed up GPU communication at scale. Finally, we also design topology-aware, link-efficient, and cooperative GPU kernels to significantly accelerate All-reduce operation, which is the primary performance bottleneck in deep learning applications. The proposed designs demonstrate significant performance improvements over the state-of-the-art communication schemes for various HPC and deep learning applications."

      "description": "Modern multi-petaflop HPC systems are powered by dense multi-/many-core architectures and this trend is expected to grow for the next-generation supercomputing systems. This rapid adoption of high core-density architectures by the current- and next-generation HPC systems is further fueled by the emerging application trends such as Deep Learning. This is putting more emphasis on middleware designers to optimize various communication protocols to meet the diverse needs of the applications. While the novelties in the processor architectures have led to the increased on-chip parallelism, they come at the cost of rendering traditional designs, employed by the communication runtimes such as MPI, to suffer from higher degree of intra-node communication latencies. Tackling the computation and communication challenges that accompany these dense multi-/many-cores garner special design considerations. The proposed work in this thesis tries to address the performance challenges posed by a diverse range of applications and the lacking support in state-of-the-art communication libraries such as MPI to exploit high-concurrency architectures. The author first proposes a \"shared-address-spaces\"-based communication substrate to derive intra-node communication in MPI. Atop this framework, the author has re-designed various MPI primitives such as point-to-point communication protocols (e.g., user-space zero-copy rendezvous transfer), collective communication (e.g., load/store based collectives, truly zero-copy and partitioning-based reduction algorithms), and efficient MPI derived datatypes processing (e.g., memoization-based \"packing-free\" communication) to exploit the potential of emerging multi-/many-core architectures and high throughput networks. The proposed designs have demonstrated significant improvement over state-of-the-art for various scientific and deep learning applications."

However, CCSNe are highly complex and inherently non-linear phenomena. Large-scale simulations of these cosmic events can provide us a glimpse of their hydrodynamic and nucleosynthetic processes which are difficult to observe. To enable these massive numerical simulations on high-performance computing (HPC) centers, this study uses FleCSPH, a parallel and distributed code, based on the smooth-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) formulation. In the recent years, the HPC architecture has evolved and the next generation of exascale computers are expected to feature heterogenous architecture. Therefore, it is important to maintain code portability across platforms. This work demonstrates code portability of FleCSPH through the incorporation of Kokkos C++ library and containers using Charliecloud."

Epsilon represents the most time-consuming routines in the BerkeleyGW workflow for large-scale material science simulations. Some of the porting/optimization strategies include, changing our original data layout to efficiently use libraries such as cuBLAS and cuFFT, implementation of specific CUDA kernels to minimize data copies between host/device and keeping data on device, efficient use of data streams to leverage high concurrency on the device, asynchronous memory copies and overlapping (MPI) communication on the host and computation on the device. Preliminary results are presented in terms of the speedup compare to the CPU-only implementation, strong/weak scaling, and power efficiency. Excellent acceleration is demonstrated: up to 30x for specific kernels. Our port also exhibits good scalability and about 16x higher FLOPs/watt efficiency compared to the CPU-only implementation."

In this paper, we propose a Common Workflow Language (CWL) compliant workflow management system. BeeCWL is a parser to derive meaningful information such as requirements, steps, relationships, etc. from CWL files and to create a graph database from those components. Generated graphs can be passed to an arbitrary scheduler and management system to decide whether there are enough resources to optimize and execute the workflow.

As we move to exascale, however, detection of performance anomalies will become increasingly important with the increase in size and complexity of systems. There are very few accepted ways of detecting anomalies in the literature, and there are no published and labeled sets of anomalous HPC behavior. In this research, we develop a suite of applications that represent HPC workloads and use data from a lightweight metric collection service to train machine learning models to predict the future behavior of metrics.

      "description": "We evaluate the performance of Devito, a domain specific language (DSL) for finite differences on Arm ThunderX2 processors. Experiments with two common seismic computational kernels demonstrate that Devito can apply automatic code generation and optimization across Arm and Intel platforms. The code transformations include: parallelism, and SIMD vectorization (OpenMP >=4); loop tiling (with best block shape obtained via auto-tuning); domain-specific symbolic optimisation such as common sub-expression elimination and factorisation for Flop reduction, polynomial approximations for trigonometry terms, and heuristic hoisting of time-invariant expressions. Results show that Devito can achieve performance on Arm processors which is competitive to other Intel Xeon processors."

      "description": "LIKWID is a tool suite for performance oriented programmers with a worldwide user group. It is developed by the HPC group of the University Erlangen-Nuremberg since 2009 to support them in their daily research and performance engineering of user codes. The HPC landscape has become more and more diverse over the last years with clusters using non-x86 architectures and being equipped with accelerators. With the new major version, the architectural support of LIKWID is extended to ARM and POWER CPUs with the same functionality and features as for x86 architectures. Besides the CPU monitoring, the new version provides access the hardware counting facilities of Nvidia GPUs. This poster introduces the new features and shows the successes of applying LIKWID to identify performance bottlenecks and to test optimizations. Furthermore, the poster gives an overview of how users can integrate the LIKWID tools in their application using a lightweight add-once-and-reuse instrumentation API."

      "description": "We seek to efficiently solve a generalized class of partial differential equations called the phase-field equations. These non-linear PDE\u2019s model phase transition (solidification, melting, phase-separation) phenomena which exhibit spatially and temporally localized regions of steep gradients. We consider time as an additional dimension and simultaneously solve for the unknown in large blocks of time (i.e. in space-time), instead of the standard approach of sequential time-stepping. We use  variational multiscale (VMS) based finite element approach to solve the ensuing space-time equations. This allows us to (a) exploit parallelism not only in space but also in time, (b) gain high order accuracy in time, and (c) exploit adaptive refinement approaches to locally refine region of interest in both space and time. We illustrate this approach with several canonical problems including melting and solidification of complex snow flake structures."

      "description": "Task graphs provide a simple way to describe scientific workflows (sets of tasks with dependencies) that can be executed on both HPC clusters and in the cloud. An important aspect of executing such graphs is the used scheduling algorithm. Many scheduling heuristics have been proposed in existing works; nevertheless, they are often tested in oversimplified environments. We introduce a simulation environment designed for prototyping and benchmarking task schedulers. Our simulation environment, scheduler source codes, and graph datasets are open in order to be fully reproducible. To demonstrate usage of Estee, as an example, we compare the performance of various workflow schedulers in an environment using two different network models."

      "description": "Power of large-scale systems such as an HPC or a datacenter is a significant issue. Cooling units consume 30% of the total power. General control policies for cooling units are local and static (manual overall optimization nearly once a week). However, free cooling and IT-load fluctuation may change hourly optimum control variables of the cooling units. In this work, we present a deep neural network (DNN) power simulator that can learn from actual operating logs and can quickly identify the optimum control variables. We demonstrated the power simulator of an actual large-scale system with 4.7-MW-power IT load. Our robust simulator predicted the total power with error of 4.8% without retraining during one year. We achieved optimization by the simulator within 80 seconds that was drastically faster than previous works. The dynamic control optimization each hour showed a 15% power reduction compared to that of conventional policy in the actual system."

      "description": "Many scientific domains require the solution of high dimensional PDEs. Traditional grid- or mesh-based methods for solving such systems in a noise-free manner quickly become intractable due to the scaling of the degrees of freedom going as O(N^d) sometimes called \"the curse of dimensionality.\" We are developing an arbitrarily high-order discontinuous-Galerkin finite-element solver that leverages an adaptive sparse-grid discretization whose degrees of freedom scale as O(N*log2 N^D-1). This method and its subsequent reduction in the required resources is being applied to several PDEs including time-domain Maxwell's equations (3D), the Vlasov equation (in up to 6D) and a Fokker-Planck-like problem in ongoing related efforts. Here we present our implementation which is designed to run on multiple accelerated architectures, including distributed systems. Our implementation takes advantage of a system matrix decomposed as the Kronecker product of many smaller matrices which is implemented as batched operations."

      "description": "In this presentation, we introduce an ongoing effort of an online training platform aimed to automate the training of developers to quickly extend compilers - FreeCompilerCamp.org. Our free and open platform allows anyone who is interested in developing compilers to learn the necessary skills. A live training website, built on top of Play-With-Docker, is set up so that anyone with internet access and a web browser will be able to take this training. The entire training system is open-source and developers with relevant skills can contribute new tutorials and deploy it on a private server, workstation or even laptop. We have created some initial tutorials on how to extend the Clang/LLVM or ROSE compilers to support new OpenMP features.  Using a web interface consisting of two side-by-side panels, users can follow the tutorials on one side and immediately practice what they learned in a terminal sandbox embedded on the other."

      "description": "SmartK is our efficient and scalable parallel algorithm for Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), an approximation technique for game searches.  MCTS is also used to solve problems as diverse as planning under uncertainty, combinatorial optimization, and high-energy physics.  In these problems, the solution search space is significantly large, necessitating parallel solutions.  Shared memory parallel approaches do not scale well beyond the size of a single node's RAM.  SmartK is a distributed memory parallelization that takes advantage of both inter-node and intra-node parallelism and a large cumulative RAM found in clusters.  SmartK's novel selection algorithm combined with its ability to efficiently search the solution space, results in better solutions than other MCTS parallel approaches.  Results of an MPI implementation of SmartK for the game of Hex, show SmartK yields a better win percentage than other parallel algorithms, and that its performance scales to larger search spaces and high degrees of parallelism."

      "description": "The purpose of this work is to develop and parallelize an accurate and efficient numerical method for the computation of synchrotron radiation from relativistic electrons in the near field. The high-brilliance electron beam and coherent short-wavelength light source provide a powerful method to understand the microscopic structure and dynamics of materials. Such a method supports a wide range of applications including matter physics, structural biology, and medicine development. To understand the interaction between the beam and synchrotron radiation, an accurate and efficient numerical simulation is needed. With millions of electrons, the computational cost of the field would be large. Thus, multilevel parallelism and performance portability are desired since modern supercomputers are getting more complex and heterogeneous. The performance model and performance analysis are presented."

AI Matrix results from a full investigation of the DL applications used inside Alibaba and aims to cover the typical DL applications that account for more than 90% of the GPU usage in Alibaba data centers. This benchmark suite collects DL models that are either directly used or closely resemble the models used in the company\u2019s real e-commerce applications. It also collects the real e-commerce applications if no similar DL models are not available. Through the high coverage and close resemblance to real applications, AI Matrix fully represents the DL workloads on Alibaba data centers. The collected benchmarks mainly fall into three categories: computer vision, recommendation, and language processing, which consist of the most majority of DL applications in Alibaba. AI Matrix is made open source, hoping it can benefit the public."

      "description": "This poster focuses on a preconditioned conjugate gradient based iterative eigensolver using an unconstrained energy functional minimization scheme. This scheme avoids an explicit reorthogonalization of the trial eigenvectors and becomes an attractive alternative for the solution of very large problems. The unconstrained formulation is implemented in the first-principles materials and chemistry CP2K code, which performs electronic structure calculations based on a density functional theory approximation to the solution of the many-body Schr\u00f6dinger equation. The systems we use in our studies have a number of atoms ranging from 2,247 to 12,288. We study the convergence of the unconstrained formulation and its scaling on a Cray XC40 (a partition with 9,688 Intel KNL nodes). We show that there is a trade-off between the preconditioner that leads to fast convergence and lower cost preconditioners that lead to best time to solution."

Components in the stack are interdependent, such that effort in tuning the parameters in these software libraries for optimal performance is non-trivial.  On the other hand, it is challenging to choose an array management library based on the array configuration and access patterns.  In this poster, we investigate the performance aspect of two array management libraries, i.e., HDF5 and Zarr, in the context of a neuroscience use case.  We highlight the performance variability of HDF5 and Zarr in our preliminary results and discuss potential optimization strategies."

However, the precision generally plays a contrary role for both. Therefore, the ultimate concept for maximizing both at the same time is the minimal-precision computation through precision-tuning, which adjusts the optimal precision for each operation and data. Several studies have been already conducted for it so far, but the scope of those studies is limited to the precision-tuning alone. In this study, we propose a more broad concept of the minimal-precision computing with precision-tuning, involving both hardware and software stack."

      "description": "High performance computing (HPC) scientific applications require complex dependencies to operate. As user demand for HPC systems increases, it becomes unrealistic to support every unique dependency request. Containers can offer the ability to satisfy the users\u2019 dependency request while simultaneously offering HPC portability across systems. By \u201ccontainerizing\u201d Model for Prediction Across Scales (MPAS, a large atmospheric simulation suite), we show that it is possible to containerize and run complex software. Furthermore, the container can be run across different HPC systems with nearly identical results (21 bytes difference over 2.1 gigabytes). Containers have the possibility to bring flexibility to code teams in HPC by helping to meet the demand for user defined software stacks (UDSS), and giving teams the ability to choose their software, independently of what is offered by the HPC system."

      "description": "Apache Spark and Apache Flink are two Big Data frameworks used for fast data exploration and analysis. Both frameworks provide the runtime of program sections and performance metrics, such as the number of bytes read or written, via an integrated dashboard. Performance metrics available in the dashboard lack timely information and are only shown aggregated in a separate part of the dashboard. However, performance investigations and optimizations would benefit from an integrated view with detailed performance metric events. Thus, we propose a system that samples metrics at runtime and collects information about the program sections after the execution finishes. The performance data is stored in an established format independent from Spark and Flink versions and can be viewed with state-of-the-art performance tools, i.e. Vampir. The overhead depends on the sampling interval and was below 10% in our experiments."

There are various phases of a system\u2019s life-cycle to assess, requiring different methods to accomplish effective evaluation of performance and correctness. Due to the unique and distributed nature of an HPC-system, the necessity for sophisticated tools to automatically harness and assess test results, all while interacting with schedulers and programming environment software, requires a customizable, extensible, and lightweight system to manage concurrent testing. Beginning with the recently refactored codebase of Pavilion 1.0, we assisted with the finishing touches on readying this software for open-source release and production usage. Pavilion 2.0 is a Python 3-based testing framework for HPC clusters that facilitates the building, running, and analysis of tests through an easy-to-use, flexible, YAML-based configuration system. This enables users to write their own tests by simply wrapping everything in Pavilion\u2019s well-defined format."

In this paper, we propose a multi-pattern quantum search methodology based on a modified GS quantum circuit. The proposed method combines classical post-processing permutations with a modified Grover's circuit to efficiently search for given single/multiple input patterns. Our proposed methodology reduces quantum circuit complexity, realizes space-efficient emulation hardware and improves overall system configurability for dynamic, multi-pattern search. We use a high-performance reconfigurable computer to emulate multi-pattern GS(MGS) and present scalable emulation architectures of a complete multi-pattern search system. We validate the system and provide analysis of experimental results in terms of FPGA resource utilization and emulation time. Our results include a successful hardware architecture that is capable of emulating MGS algorithm up to 32 fully-entangled quantum bits on a single FPGA."

      "description": "Workload balance among MPI processes is a critical consideration during the development of HPC applications. However, because of many factors such as complex network interconnections and irregularity of HPC applications, fully achieving workload balance in practice is nearly impossible. Although interprocess job stealing is a promising solution, existing shared-memory techniques that lack necessary flexibility or cause inefficiency during data access cannot provide an applicable job-stealing implementation. To solve this problem, we propose a new process-in-process (PiP) interprocess job-stealing method to balance communication workload among processes on MPI layers. Our initial experimental results show PiP-based job stealing can efficiently help amortize workload, reduce imbalance, and greatly improve intra- and intersocket ping-pong performance compared with original MPI."

      "description": "Physics-informed generative adversarial networks (PI-GANs) are used to learn the underlying probability distributions of spatially-varying material properties (e.g., microstructure variability in a polycrystalline material). While standard GANs rely solely on data for training, PI-GANs encode physics in the form of stochastic differential equations using automatic differentiation. The goal here is to show that experimental data from a limited number of material tests can be used with PI-GANs to enable unlimited virtual testing for aerospace applications. Preliminary results using synthetically generated data are provided to demonstrate the proposed framework. Deep learning and automatic differentiation capabilities in Tensorflow were implemented on Nvidia Tesla V100 GPUs."

We demonstrate ExaGeoStatR package by illustrating its implementation details, analyzing its performance on various parallel architectures, and assessing its accuracy using synthetic datasets and a sea surface temperature dataset.

In this research, we tackle one of the most difficult problems of GPU parallelization of the factorization of these hierarchical matrices. To this end, we are developing a new runtime system for GPUs that can schedule all tasks into one GPU kernel. Other existing runtime systems, like cuGraph and Standford Legion, can only manage streams and kernel-level parallelism. Even without too much tuning, we achieved 4x better performance in H-LU factorization with a single GPU when comparing with a well-tuned CPU-based hierarchical matrix library, HLIBpro, on moderately sized matrices. Additionally, we have significantly less runtime overheads exposed when processing smaller matrices."

      "description": "With the emergence of fast local storage, multi-level checkpointing (MLC) has become a common approach for efficient checkpointing. To utilize MLC efficiently, it is important to determine the optimal configuration for the checkpoint/restart (CR). There are mainly two approaches for determining the optimal configuration for CR, namely modeling and simulation approach. However, with MLC, CR becomes more complicated making the modeling approach inaccurate and the simulation approach though accurate, very slow. In this poster, we focus on optimizing the performance of CR by predicting the optimized checkpoint count and interval. This was achieved by combining the simulation approach with machine learning and neural network to leverage its accuracy without spending time on simulating different CR parameters. We demonstrate that our models can predict the optimized parameter values with minimal error when compared to the simulation approach."

      "description": "In addition to scalability, performance of sequential code in applications is an important factor in HPC. Typically, programs are compiled once, at which time optimizations are applied, and are then run several times. However, not all information relevant for performance optimizations are available at compile-time, restricting optimization possibilities. The generation of specialized code at runtime allows for further optimizations. Performing such specialization on binary code allows for initial code to be generated at compile-time with only the relevant parts being rewritten at runtime, reducing the optimization overhead. For targeted optimizations and effective use of known runtime information, the rewriting process needs to be guided by the application itself, exploiting information only known to the developer.<br><br>We describe three approaches for self-guided binary rewriting explicitly guided by the running application and evaluate the performance of the optimized code as well as the performance of the rewriting process itself."

Leveraging software abstraction concepts within Kokkos, software resilience for end user code is made portable with abstractions and concepts while implementing the most efficient resilience algorithms internally.  This addition enables an application to manage hardware failures reducing the cost of interruption without drastically increasing the software maintenance cost.  Two main resilience methodologies have been added to the Kokkos ecosystem to validate the resilience abstractions: 1. Checkpointing includes an automatic mode supporting other checkpointing libraries and a manual mode which leverages the data abstraction and memory space concepts.  2. The redundant execution model anticipates failures by replicating data and execution paths.  The design and implementation of these additions are illustrated, and appropriate examples are included to demonstrate the simplicity of use."

      "description": "We present a parallelization scheme for classical simulations of quantum circuits.  Our scheme is based on a recent method to \"cut'' large quantum circuits into smaller sub-circuits that can be simulated independently, and whose simulation results can in turn be re-combined to infer the output of the original circuit.  The exponentially smaller classical computing resources needed to simulate smaller circuits are counterbalanced by exponential overhead in terms of classical post-processing costs.  We discuss how this overhead can be massively parallelized to reduce classical computing costs."

      "description": "Quantum computing (QC) is emerging as a potential post-Moore high-performance computing (HPC) technology. Trapped-ion quantum bits (qubits) are among the most leading technologies to reach scalable quantum computers that would solve certain problems beyond the capabilities of even the largest classical supercomputers. In trapped-ion QC, qubits can physically move on the ion trap. The state-of-the-art architecture, linear-tape model, only requires a few laser beams to interact with the entire qubits by physically moving the interacting ions to the execution zone. Since the laser beams are limited resources, the ion chain movement and quantum gate scheduling are critical for the circuit latency. To harness the emerging architecture, we present our mathematical model for scheduling the qubit movements and quantum gates in order to minimize the circuit latency. In our experiment, our scheduling reduces 29.47% circuit latency on average. The results suggest classical HPC would further improve the quantum circuit optimization."

Second, we develop bespoke error estimation mechanisms capable of processing this uncertainty to provide instant feedback on the confidence in predictions without relying on the availability of ground truth data. To our knowledge, the ability to estimate the discrepancy in predictions without labels is a first in the field of AI for Engineering."

      "description": "Numerical plasma physics models such as the particle-in-cell XGC code are important tools to understand phenomena encountered in experimental fusion devices. Adequately resolved simulations are computationally expensive, so optimization is essential. To address the need for consistent high performance by cutting-edge scientific software applications, frameworks such as Kokkos have been developed to enable portability as new architectures require hardware-specific coding implementation for best performance. Cabana, a recent extension to Kokkos developed with the ECP-CoPA project, is a library of common kernels and operations typically necessary for particle-based codes. The Kokkos/Cabana framework enables intuitive construction of particle-based codes, while maintaining portability between architectures. Here, we summarize the adoption by XGC of the execution and data layout patterns offered by this framework. We demonstrate a method for Fortran codes to adopt Kokkos and show that it can provide a single, portable code base that performs well on both GPUs and multicore machines."

While SCM can deliver higher capacity and lower standby power than DRAM, it is slower and the dynamic power is higher. Therefore, in order to realize high-speed, low-power and scalable main memory, it is necessary to build an SCM/DRAM unified memory, and dynamically optimize data placement between the two memories according to the memory access pattern. <br><br>In this poster, we describe a new hybrid access type virtual memory method using TLB-extended unified memory management unit which enables collecting and extracting fine-grained memory access locality characteristics.

      "description": "3D image registration is one of the most fundamental and computationally expensive operations in medical image analysis. Here, we present a mixed-precision, Gauss-Newton-Krylov solver for diffeomorphic registration. Our work extends the publicly available CLAIRE library to GPU architectures. Despite the importance of image registration, only a few implementations of large deformation diffeomorphic registration packages support GPUs. Our contributions are new algorithms and dedicated computational kernels to significantly reduce the runtime of the main computational kernels in CLAIRE: derivatives and interpolation. We deploy (i) highly-optimized, mixed-precision GPU-kernels for the evaluation of scattered-data interpolation, (ii) replace FFT-based first-order derivatives with optimized 8th-order finite differences, and (iii) compare with state-of-the-art CPU and GPU implementations. As a highlight, we demonstrate that we can register 256^3 clinical images in less than 6 seconds on a single NVIDIA Tesla V100. This amounts to over 20x speed-up over CLAIRE and over 30x speed-up over existing GPU implementations."

      "description": "The past few years have seen a surge of using Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms for traditional HPC tasks such as feature detection, numerical analysis, and graph analytics. While ML and DL enable solving HPC tasks, their adoption has been hampered due to the lack of understanding of how they utilize systems. Optimizing these algorithms requires characterizing their performance across the hardware/software (HW/SW) stack, but the lack of simple tools to automate the process and the reliance on researchers to perform manual characterization is a bottleneck. To alleviate this, we propose an across-stack profiling scheme and integrate it within MLModelScope \u2014 a hardware and software agnostic tool for evaluating and benchmarking ML/DL at scale. We demonstrate MLModelScope\u2019s ability to characterize state-of-art ML/DL models and give insights that are only possible obtained by performing across-stack profiling."

Especially in tumor development, single cells play a crucial role in advance of tumor properties.<br><br>We developed a simulation framework that can model tissue development up to the centimeter scale with micrometer resolution of single cells.  Through a full parallelization, it enables the efficient use of HPC systems, therefore enabling detailed simulations on a large scale.

      "description": "Neural network-based recommendation models have been widely applied on tracking personalization and recommendation tasks at large Internet companies such as e-commerce companies and social media companies. Alibaba recommendation system deploys WDL (wide and deep learning) models for product recommendation tasks. The WDL model consists of two main parts: embedding lookup and neural network-based feature ranking model that ranks different products for different users. As more and more products and users the model need to rank, the feature length and batch size of the models are increased. The computation of models is also increased so that traditional model inference implementation on CPU cannot meet the requirement of QPS (query per second) and latency of recommendation tasks. In this poster, we develop a GPU based system to speedup recommendation system inference performance. By model quantization and graph transformation, we can achieve 3.9x performance speedup when compared with a baseline GPU implementation."

We introduce a novel hybrid design for memory accesses that handles the burst mode in traversal based algorithms, like BFS and SSSP, and reduces the number of remote accesses and updates.  We demonstrate that our designs offer up to 84% speedup over our NUMA-oblivious framework Totem and 2.86x over shared-nothing distributed design, for BFS and SSSP algorithms."

      "description": "Commercial adiabatic quantum annealers such as D-Wave 2000Q have the potential to solve NP-complete optimization problems efficiently. One of the primary constraints of such devices is the limited number and connectivity of their qubits. This research presents two exact decomposition methods (for the Maximum Clique and the Minimum Vertex Cover problem) that allow us to solve problems of arbitrarily large sizes by splitting them up recursively into a series of arbitrarily small subproblems. Those subproblems are then solved exactly or approximately using a quantum annealer. Whereas some previous approaches are based on heuristics that do not guarantee optimality of their solutions, our decomposition algorithms have the property that the optimal solution of the input problem can be reconstructed given all generated subproblems are solved optimally as well. We investigate various heuristic and exact bounds as well as reduction methods that help to increase the scalability of our approaches."

This work presents a dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) package for GPU-accelerated mesoscale flow simulations in nanoporous materials. In an ideal benchmark that minimizes load imbalance, the package delivered nearly perfect strong- and weak-scaling (with up to 4 billion DPD particles) on up to 1,536 V100 GPUs on Oak Ridge National Laboratory's Summit supercomputer. More remarkably, in a benchmark to measure its usefulness with realistic nanopores in SBA-15 silica, the package exhibited more than 20x speedup over its LAMMPS-based CPU counterpart with the same number nodes (e.g., 384 V100 GPUs vs. 2,688 POWER9 cores). It is worth highlighting that the NVLink2 Host-to-Device interconnects kept the cost of CPU-GPU memory copy as low as only 10% of GPU activity time per rank: 4 times less than their PCIe counterparts."

      "description": "Data fidelity is of prominent importance for scientific experiments and simulations.  The state-of-the-art mechanism to ensure data fidelity is through data provenance.  However, the provenance data itself may as well exhibit unintentional human errors and malicious data manipulation.  To enable a trustworthy and reliable data fidelity service, we advocate achieving the immutability and decentralization of scientific data provenance through blockchains.  Specifically, we propose HPChain, a new blockchain framework specially designed for HPC systems.  HPChain employs a new consensus protocol compatible with and optimized for HPC systems.  Furthermore, HPChain was implemented with MPI and integrated with an off-chain distributed provenance service to tolerate the failures caused by faulty MPI ranks.  The HPChain prototype system has been deployed to 500 cores at the University of Nevada's HPC center and demonstrated strong resilience and scalability while outperforming state-of-the-art blockchains by orders of magnitude."

Two optimization techniques are proposed in order to improve performance of the simulator. The \"page method\" reduces unnecessary copies in each node. It is found that this method makes approximately 17% speed-up maximum. Initial permutation of qubits is also studied how it affects performance of the simulator. It is found that a simple permutation in ascending order of the number of operations for each qubit is sufficient in the case of simulations of quantum adder circuits."

      "description": "In the era of data-intensive computing, accessing data with a high-throughput and low-latency is very imperative. Data prefetching is used for hiding read latency by requesting data before it is needed to move it from a high-latency medium to a low-latency one. However, existing solutions do not consider the multi-tiered storage and also suffer from under-utilization of prefetching resources and unnecessary evictions. Additionally, existing approaches implement a client-pull model where understanding the application's I/O behavior drives prefetching decisions. Moving toward exascale, where machines run multiple applications concurrently by accessing files in a workflow, a more data-centric approach resolves challenges such as cache pollution and redundancy. In this study, we present HFetch, a truly hierarchical data prefetcher that adopts a server-push approach to data prefetching. We demonstrate the benefits of such an approach. Results show 10-35% performance gains over existing prefetchers and over 50% when compared to systems with no prefetching."

      "description": "Large-scale scientific simulations can be ported to heterogeneous environments with GPUs using domain decomposition. However, Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) based simulations require all-to-all communication and large memory, which is beyond the capacity of on-chip GPU memory.  To overcome this, domain decomposition solutions are combined with adaptive sampling or pruning around the domain to reduce storage. Expression of such operations is a challenge in existing FFT libraries like FFTW, and thus it is difficult to get a high performance implementation of such methods.  We demonstrate algorithm specification for one such simulation (Hooke's law) using FFTX, an emerging API with a SPIRAL-based code generation back-end, and suggest future extensions useful for GPU-based scientific computing."

These models could successfully be employed in the past for balancing load within and between compute nodes. However, the increasing complexity of modern software and hardware makes performance predictability and load balancing much more difficult. Tackling these challenges in search for a generic solution, we present a novel library for fine-granular task-based reactive load balancing in distributed memory based on MPI and OpenMP. Our concept allows creating individual migratable tasks that can be executed on any MPI rank. Migration decisions are performed at run time based on online performance or load data.  Two fundamental approaches to balance load and at the same time overlap computation and communication are compared. We evaluate our concept under enforced power caps and clock frequency changes using a synthetic benchmark and demonstrate robustness against work-induced imbalances for an AMR application."

For example, both Intel and Xilinx are now providing OpenCL-to-FPGA toolchains. However, since GPU and FPGA devices offer different parallelism models, OpenCL code optimized for GPU can prove inefficient on FPGA, in terms of both performance and hardware resource utilization.<br><br>In this poster, we explore this problem on an emerging workload: finite state automata traversal. Specifically, we explore a set of structural code changes, custom, and best-practice optimizations to retarget an OpenCL NFA engine designed for GPU to FPGA. Our evaluation, which covers traversal throughput and resource utilization, shows that our optimizations lead, on a single execution pipeline, to speedups up to 4x over an already optimized baseline that uses one of the proposed code changes to fit the original code on FPGA."

      "description": "The implementation of high-performance parallel software is challenging and raises issues not seen in serial programs before. It requires a strategy of parallel execution which preserves correctness but maximizes scalability. Efficiently deriving well-scaling solutions remains an unsolved problem especially with the quickly-evolving hardware landscape of high-performance computing (HPC).<br><br>This work proposes a framework for classifying the efficiency of parallel programs. It bases on a strict separation between the algorithmic structure of a program and its executed functions. By decomposing parallel programs into a hierarchical structure of parallel patterns, a high-level abstraction is provided which leads to equivalence classes over parallel programs. Each equivalence class possesses efficiency properties, mainly communication and synchronization, dataflow and architecture efficiency. This classification allows for wide application areas and a workflow for structural optimization of parallel algorithms is proposed."

CUBE is a simulation framework for complex industrial flow problem, such as aerodynamics of vehicles, based on hierarchical Cartesian mesh. In incompressible CFD simulation, solving pressure Poisson equation is the most time-consuming part. In this study, we use a cavity flow simulation as a benchmark problem. With this problem, multigrid Poisson solver dominates 91% of execution time of the time-step loop. Specifically, we evaluate the performance of Gauss-Seidel loop as a computational kernel based on \u201cByte per Flop\u201d approach. With optimization of the kernel, we achieved 9.8x speedup and peak floating point performance ratio increased from 0.4% to 4.0%. We also measured parallel performance up to 8,192 nodes (65,536 cores) on the K computer. With optimization of the parallel performance, we achieved 2.9x\u20133.9x sustainable speedup in the time-step loop."

      "description": "Several institutes are operating cloud platforms that offer Web API access to Ising computers such as quantum annealing machines. Platform users can solve complex combinatorial optimization problems by using hybrid algorithms that utilize both users' conventional digital computers and remote Ising computers. However, communication via the Internet takes an order of magnitude longer time than optimization on Ising computers. This overheads seriously degrade the performance of hybrid algorithms since they involve frequent communication. In this poster, we first state issues in the design of Ising computing platforms, including communication overheads. Then, we answer the issues by introducing the computing platform for the coherent Ising machine (CIM), an Ising computer based on photonics technologies. Our platform offers efficient CIM-digital communication by allowing users to execute their program on digital computers co-located with the CIM. We have released the platform to our research collaborators in this autumn and started the evaluation."

Polymorphic Computing is the emerging field of changing the computer architecture around the software, rather than vice versa. The main contribution is a new polymorphic computing architecture. The key idea behind the architecture is to create an array of processors where a program\u2019s instructions can be individually and arbitrarily assigned/mobilized to any processor, even during runtime. The key enablers of this architecture are a dataflow instruction set that is conducive to instruction migration, a microarchitectual block called an \u201coperation cell\u201d (\u201cop-cell\u201d), a processor built around the instruction set and the \u201cop-cells\u201d, and arrays of these processors."

Yet storage and analysis of petascale genomic data is expensive, and that cost will ultimately be borne by the patients and citizens. The Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) has developed MPEG-G, a new open standard to compress, store, transmit and process genomic sequencing data that provides an evolved and superior alternative to currently used genomic file formats. Our poster will showcase software package GENIE, the first open source implementation of an encoder-decoder pair that is compliant with the MPEG-G specifications and delivers all its benefits: efficient compression, selective access, transport and analysis, guarantee of long-term support, and embedded mechanisms for annotation and encryption of compressed information.  GENIE will create a step-change in medical genomics by reducing the cost of data storage and analysis."

In this poster, we will present some preliminary impressions of the impact of the water/air cooling system on the K computer system, focusing on the potential benefits of the use of low water/air temperature respectively for the CPU and DRAM memory modules produced by the cooling system.

In this work, we introduce the batch-reduce-GEMM kernel and show how the most popular DL algorithms can be formulated with this kernel as basic building-block. Consequently, the DL library-development degenerates to mere (potentially automatic) tuning of loops around this sole optimized kernel. By exploiting our kernel we implement Recurrent Neural Networks, Convolution Neural Networks and Multilayer Perceptron training and inference primitives in just 3K lines of high-level-code. Our primitives outperform vendor-optimized libraries on multi-node CPU-Clusters. We also provide CNN kernels targeting GPUs. Finally, we demonstrate that batch-reduce-GEMM kernel within a tensor compiler yields high-performance CNN primitives."

      "description": "The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is one of the leading candidates for demonstrating quantum advantage. The quality of the solution obtained by QAOA depends on the performance of the classical optimization routine used to optimize the variational parameters. In this work, we propose a Reinforcement Learning (RL) based approach to drastically reduce the number of evaluations needed to find high-quality variational parameters. We train an RL agent on small 8-qubit Max-Cut problem instances on an Intel Xeon Phi supercomputer Bebop, and use (transfer) the learned optimization policy to quickly find high-quality solutions for other larger problem instances coming from different distributions and graph classes. The preliminary results show that our RL based approach is able to improve the quality of the obtained solution by up to 10% within a fixed budget of function evaluations and demonstrate learned optimization policy transferability between different graph classes and sizes."

This methodology can be used to discover existing patterns and correlations within a dataset. The current results indicate that the Euclidean Distance metric provides the best results in terms of internal cluster validity measures for multi-variable analyses of large-scale earth system datasets.

Different edge AI processors are diversified, since these processors are designed with different approaches. However, it is hard for customers to select an edge AI processor without an overall evaluation of these processors. We propose a three-dimensional characterization (i.e., accuracy, latency, and energy efficiency) approach on three different kinds of edge AI processors (i.e., Edge TPU, NVIDIA Xavier, and NovuTensor).  We deploy YOLOv2 and Tiny-YOLO, which are two YOLO-based object detection systems, on these edge AI platforms with Microsoft COCO dataset. I will present our work starting from the problem statement. And then I'll introduce our experiments setup and hardware configuration. Lastly, I'll conclude our experimental results and current work status, as well as the future work."

The common denominator of all these applications is the need for cheap and relatively large-scale ultrasound simulations with sufficient accuracy. Typical medical applications require full-wave simulations which take frequency-dependent absorption and non-linearity into account.<br><br>This poster investigates the benefits of high-bandwidth low-latency interconnects to k-Wave acoustic toolbox in dense multi-GPU environment. The k-Wave multi-GPU code is based on a variant of the local Fourier basis domain decomposition. The poster compares the behavior of the code on a typical PCI-E 3.0 machine with 8 Nvidia Tesla P40 GPUs and a Nvidia DGX-2 server. The performance constraints of PCI-E platforms built around multiple socket servers on multi-GPU applications are deeply explored. Finally, it is shown the k-Wave toolbox can efficiently utilize NVlink 2.0 and achieve over 4x speedup compared to PCI-E systems."

      "description": "In understanding granular dynamics, the commonly-used discrete modeling approach that tracks the motion of all particles is computationally demanding, especially with large system size. In such cases, one can contemplate switching to continuum models that are computationally less expensive. In order to assess when such a discrete to continuum switch is justified, we compare granular and fluid dynamics that scales to handle more than 1 billion degrees of freedom (DOFs); i.e., two orders of magnitude higher than the state-of-the-art. On the granular side, we solve the Newton-Euler equations of motion; on the fluid side, we solve the Navier-Stokes equations. Both solvers leverage parallel computing on the GPU, and are publicly available on GitHub as part of an open-source code called Chrono. We report similarities and differences between the dynamics of the discrete, fully-resolved system and the continuum model via numerical experiments including both static and highly transient scenarios."

Storage and file system designers therefore require a deep understanding of how HPC application I/O behavior affects current storage system installations in order to improve storage performance. In this work, we contribute to this understanding using application-agnostic file system statistics gathered on compute nodes as well as  metadata and object storage file system servers. We analyze file system statistics of more than 4 million jobs over a period of three years on two systems at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory that include a 15 PiB Lustre file system for storage. Some key observations in our study show that more than 65% HPC users perform significant I/O which are mostly writes; and less than 22% of HPC users who submit write-intensive jobs perform efficient writes to the file system."

      "description": "Load imbalance is the major source of performance degradation in computationally-intensive applications that frequently consist of parallel loops. Efficient scheduling can improve the performance of such programs. OpenMP is the de-facto standard for parallel programming on shared-memory systems. The current OpenMP specification provides only three choices for loop scheduling which are insufficient in scenarios with irregular loops, system-induced interference, or both. Therefore, this work augments the LLVM OpenMP runtime library implementation with eleven ready to use scheduling techniques. We tested existing and added scheduling strategies on several applications from NAS, SPEC OMP 2012, and CORAL2 benchmark suites.  Experiments show that implemented scheduling techniques outperform others in certain application and system configurations.  We measured performance gains of up to 6% compared to the fastest standard scheduling technique. This work aims to be a convincing step toward beyond-standard scheduling options in OpenMP for the benefit of evolving applications executing on multicore architectures."

      "description": "In HPC systems, users' requested runtime for submitted jobs plays a crucial role in  efficiency. While underestimation of job runtime could terminate jobs before completion, overestimation could result in long queuing of other jobs in HPC  systems. In reality, runtime prediction in HPC is challenging due to the complexity and dynamics of running workloads. Most of the current predictive runtime models are trained on static workloads. This poses a risk of over-fitting the predictions with bias from the learned workload distribution. In this work, we propose an adaptation of Correlation Alignment method in our deep neural network architecture (DCORAL) to alleviate the domain shift between workloads for better runtime predictions. Experiments on both standard benchmark workloads and NCAR real-time production workloads reveal that our proposed method results in a more stable training model across different workloads with low accuracy variance as compared to the other state-of-the-art methods."

It has been successful in modeling for many areas of physics, including fusion plasmas, particle accelerators, microwave devices, and RF and dielectric structures. Now it is critical to move to exascale systems, with their compute accelerator architectures, massive threading, and advanced instruction sets. Here we discuss how we are moving this complex, multiphysics computational application to the new computing paradigm, and how it is done in a way that kept the application producing physics during the move. We present performance results showing significant speedups in all parts of the PIC loop, including field updates, particle pushes, and reactions."

Since the task execution configuration strongly affects the final tasks mapping on the computational resources, the execution planning is of the highest priority.  Unlike other tools, k-Dispatch considers a variable amount of computational resources per individual tasks. Since the scaling of the individual HPC codes is never perfect, k-Dispatch may find such a good mapping even an experienced user would miss. The proposed adaptive execution planning is based on collected performance data and the current cluster utilization monitoring."

The most common approach is patch-based method, where WSIs are divided into small patches to train convolutional neural networks (CNN). This approach has significant drawbacks. To have ground truth for individual patches, detailed annotations by pathologists are required. This laborious process has become the major impediment to the development of digital pathology AI. End-to-end WSI training, however, faces the difficulties of fitting the task into limited GPU memory. In this work, we improved the efficiency of using system memory for GPU compute by 411% through memory optimization and deployed the training pipeline on 8 nodes, totally 32 GPUs distributed system, achieving 147.28x speedup. We demonstrated that CNN is capable of learning features without detailed annotations. The trained CNN can correctly classify cancerous specimen, with performance level closely matching the patch-based methods."

      "description": "Tall-Skinny QR (TSQR) is an efficient algorithm for calculating the QR decomposition of m x n matrices where m << n, which is done by recursively performing QR decomposition on subdivided blocks of the tall and skinny matrix. Such operations are useful for low-rank approximation methods, which are replacing more and more dense linear algebra in both scientific computing and machine learning fields. The present work focuses on the implementation of this important algorithm on Tensor Cores, which are available on the latest NVIDIA GPUs. We evaluate the speed, accuracy, and stability of TSQR on TensorCores."

Our design leverages the Coherent Accelerator Processor Interface (CAPI) on the OpenPOWER, which provides cache-coherent access for FPGA. This technology highly improves CPU-FPGA data communication bandwidth and programming efficiency. X265 is optimized on the OpenPOWER platform to improve its performance with both architecture specific methods and hardware-acceleration methods. For hardware acceleration, frame-level acceleration and functional-unit-level acceleration are introduced and evaluated in this work."

      "description": "In a distributed deep learning training setting, using accelerators such as GPUs can be challenging to develop a high throughput model. If the accelerators are not utilized effectively, this could mean more time to solution, and thus the model's throughput is low. To use accelerators effectively across multiple nodes, we need to utilize an effective data pipelining mechanism that handles scaling gracefully so GPUs can be exploited of their parallelism.  We study the effect of using the correct pipelining mechanism that is followed by tensorflow official models vs a naive pipelining mechanism that doesn't scale well, on two image classification models. Both the models using the optimized data pipeline demonstrate effective linear scaling when GPUs are added. We also show that converting to TF Records is not always necessary ."

GPUs are thought to be good candidates for accelerating such applications with many meshes where an MGCG solver could show high performance. No previous studies have evaluated and discussed the numerical character of an MGCG solver on GPUs. Consequently, we have implemented and optimized our \u201ckinaco\u201d numerical ocean model with an MGCG solver on GPUs. We evaluated its performance and discussed inter-GPU communications on a coarse grid on which GPUs could be intrinsically problematic. We achieved 3.9 times speedup compared to CPUs and learned how inter-GPU communications depended on the number of GPUs and the aggregation level of information in a multigrid method."

      "description": "Exascale computers consume large amounts of power both for computing and cooling-units. As power of the computer varies dynamically corresponding to the load change, cooling-units are desirable to follow it for effective energy management. Because of time lags in cooling-unit operations, advance control is inevitable and an accurate prediction is a key for it. Conventional prediction methods make use of the similarity between job information while in queue. The prediction fails if there is no previously similar job. We developed two models to correct the prediction after queued jobs start running. By taking power histories into account, power-correlated topic model reselects more suitable candidate and recurrent-neural-network model considering variable network sizes predicts power variation from shape features of it. We integrated these into a single algorithm and demonstrated high-precision prediction with an average relative error of 5.7% in K computer as compared to the 18.0% obtained using the conventional method."

      "description": "Due to the unparalleled magnitude of data movement in extreme scale computing, I/O has become a central challenge. Modern storage environments have proposed the use of multiple layers between applications and the PFS. Nonetheless, the difference in capacities and speeds between storage layers makes it extremely challenging to evict data from upper layers to lower layers efficiently. However, current solutions are executed in  batches, compromising latency; are also push-based implementations, compromising resource utilization. Hence, we propose HFlush, a continuous data eviction mechanism built on a streaming architecture that is pull-based and in which each component is decoupled and executed in parallel. Initial results have shown RFlush to obtain a 7X latency reduction and a 2X bandwidth improvement over a baseline batch-based system. Therefore, RFlush is a promising solution to the growing challenges of extreme scale data generation and eviction shortcomings when archiving data across multiple tiers of storage."

A common concern is that containers may introduce application performance overhead. Prior work has not tested a  broad set of HPC container technologies on a broad set of benchmarks. This poster addresses the gap by comparing performance of the three HPC container implementations (Charliecloud, Shifter, and Singularity) and bare metal on multiple dimensions using industry-standard benchmarks.<br><br>We found no meaningful performance differences between the four environments with the possible exception of modest variation in memory usage, which is broadly consistent with prior results. This result suggests that HPC users should feel free to containerize their applications without concern about performance degradation, regardless of the container technology used. It is an encouraging development on the path towards greater adoption of user-defined software stacks to increase the flexibility of HPC."

A fast scalable equation-based implicit solver on unstructured finite elements is accelerated with a Tensor Core-enabled matrix-vector product kernel. The developed kernel attains 1.10 ExaFLOPS, leading to 416 PFLOPS for the whole solver on full Summit. This corresponds to a 75-fold speedup from a previous state-of-the-art solver running on full Piz Daint. This result could lead to breakthroughs in earthquake disaster mitigation. Our new idea in the HPC algorithm design of combining equation-based modeling with AI is expected to have broad impacts in other earth science and industrial problems."

      "description": "Entrainment and mixing processes occur during the entire life of a cloud. These processes change the droplet size distribution, which determines rain formation and radiative properties. Since it is a microphysical process, it cannot be resolved in large scale weather forecasting models. Small scale simulations such as Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) are required to resolve the smallest scale of these processes. However, it has been a challenge to visualize these processes in a 3D domain as it generates petabytes of data. Visualization plays a vital role in analyzing and understanding these huge data outputs. Here, we present different techniques for 3D visualization of data obtained from DNS carried out at Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) to understand cloud microphysical properties more closely. <br><br>Multiple tools were used to conduct a visual analysis of this data. Two of these tools are well established and tested technologies: ParaView and VAPOR. The others are emergent technologies created at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) and are in the development phase. This data simulation, in addition to exploring DNS as mentioned above, provided an opportunity to test and improve development of several tools and methods."

      "description": "The advent of machine and deep learning algorithms on petascale supercomputers is accelerating the pace of discovery in astrophysics and poses significant challenges to the interpretability of these deep neural networks.  We present a novel visualization of a deep neural network output during training as it is learning to classify galaxy images as either spiral or elliptical.  The network is trained using labeled datasets from the citizen science campaign, Galaxy Zoo, adopted by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.  These trained neural network models can then be used to classify galaxies in the Dark Energy Survey that overlap the footprint of both surveys. Visualizing a reduced representation of the network output, projected into 3-D parameter space, reveals how the network has discovered two distinct clusters of features which allows it to classify galaxies into two groups.  These visualizations of the neural network during training aid in the interpretability of the black box of deep learning and reveal how the network responds to the input images at various stages of training.  Finally, it allows a wider net to be cast to a general audience, thereby generating interest in and visibility to an otherwise highly specialized field."

      "description": "Galactic winds \u2013 outflows of gas driven out of galaxies by the combined effects of thousands of supernovae \u2013 are a crucial feature of galaxy evolution. Despite their importance, a complete theoretical picture of these winds has been elusive. Simulating the complicated interaction between the hot, high pressure gas created by supernovae and the cooler, high density gas in the galaxy disk requires massive computational resources and sophisticated software. For this purpose, Computational Hydrodynamics On Parallel Architectures (Cholla) has been demonstrated to be a scalable and efficient tool that operates in large, distributed multi-GPU environments at high levels of performance. This additional performance results in unprecedented resolution for this type of simulation and massive amounts of generated data. This raises the requirements for analysis tools that can cope with scale and complexity of the simulated physical processes. To address those challenges, we utilize NVIDIA IndeX as a scalable framework to visualize the simulation output: NVIDIA IndeX features a streaming-based architecture to interactively explore simulation results in large-scale, multi-GPU environments. We utilize customized sampling programs for multi-volume and surface rendering to address analysis questions of galactic wind simulations. This combination of massively parallel simulation and analysis allows us to utilize recent supercomputer capabilities and to speed up the exploration of galactic wind simulations."

      "description": "We present the visualization of the largest interstellar turbulence simulations ever performed, unravelling key astrophysical processes concerning the formation of stars and the relative role of magnetic fields. The simulations, including pure hydrodynamical (HD) and magneto-hydrodynamical (MHD) runs, up to a size of 10048^3 grid elements, were produced on the supercomputers of the Leibniz Supercomputing Centre and visualized using the hybrid parallel (MPI + TBB) ray-tracing engine OSPRay associated with VisIt. Besides revealing features of turbulence with an unprecedented resolution, the visualizations brilliantly showcase the stretching-and-folding mechanisms through which astrophysical processes such as supernova explosions drive turbulence and amplify the magnetic field in the interstellar gas, and how the first structures, the seeds of newborn stars are shaped by this process."

      "description": "Conversion of sunlight into chemical energy, namely photosynthesis, is the primary energy source of life on Earth. An explanatory visualization depicting this process is presented in the form of an excerpt from the fulldome show Birth of Planet Earth. This accessible visual narrative shows a lay audience, especially children, how the energy of sunlight is captured, converted, and stored through a chain of proteins to power living cells. The visualization is the result of a multi-year collaboration among biophysicists, visualization scientists, and artists, which, in turn, is based on a decade-long experimental-computational collaboration on structural and functional modeling that produced an atomic detail description of a bacterial bioenergetic organelle, the chromatophore. The energy conversion steps depicted feature an integration of function from electronic to cell levels, spanning nearly 12 orders of magnitude in time scales modeled with multi-scale computational approaches. This atomic detail description uniquely enables a modern retelling of one of humanity's earliest stories---the interplay between light and life."

      "description": "Our studies show that the storage engines of existing graph processing systems are inefficient when running concurrent jobs due to redundant data storage and access overhead. We developed a storage system GraphM. It can be integrated into the existing graph processing systems to efficiently support concurrent iterative graph processing jobs for higher throughput by fully exploiting the similarities of the data accesses between these jobs. GraphM regularizes the traversing order of the graph partitions for concurrent graph processing jobs by streaming the partitions into the cache in a common order, and then processes the related jobs concurrently in a novel fine-grained synchronization. Then, the concurrent jobs share the same graph structure data in the cache/memory and also the data accesses to the graph, amortizing the storage consumption and the data access overhead. We plug GraphM into state-of-the-art graph processing systems and  show that it improves the throughput by 1.73-13 times."

      "description": "Ontologies have become an increasingly popular semantic layer for integrating multiple heterogeneous datasets. However, significant challenges remain with supporting efficient and scalable processing of queries with data linked with ontologies (ontological queries). Ontological query processing queries requires explicitly defined query patterns be expanded to capture implicit ones, based on available ontology inference axioms. However, in practice such as in the biomedical domain, the complexity of the ontological axioms results in significantly large query expansions which present day query processing infrastructure cannot support. In particular, it remains unclear how to effectively parallelize such queries. <br><br>In this paper, we propose data and query transformations that enable inter-operator parallelism of ontological queries on Hadoop platforms. Our transformation techniques exploit ontological axioms, second order data types, and operator rewritings to eliminate expensive query substructures for increased parallelizability.  Comprehensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets show up to 25x performance improvement over existing approaches."

      "description": "Scientific applications often store datasets in self-describing data file formats, such as HDF5 and netCDF. Regrettably, to efficiently search the metadata within these files remains challenging due to the sheer size of the datasets. Existing solutions extract the metadata and store it in external database management systems (DBMS) to locate desired data. However, this practice introduces significant overhead and complexity in extraction and querying. In this research, we propose a novel Metadata Indexing and Querying Service (MIQS), which removes the external DBMS and utilizes in-memory index to achieve efficient metadata searching. MIQS follows the self-contained data management paradigm and provides portable and schema-free metadata indexing and querying functionalities for self-describing file formats. We have evaluated MIQS with the state-of-the-art MongoDB-based metadata indexing solution. MIQS achieved up to 99% time reduction in index construction and up to 172k\u00d7 search performance improvement with up to 75% reduction in memory footprint."

      "description": "High-fidelity blood flow simulations are a key step toward better understanding biophysical phenomena at the microscale, such as vasodilation, vasoconstriction, and overall vascular resistance. To this end, we present a fast scalable platform for the simulation of red blood cell (RBC) flows through complex capillaries by modeling the physical system as a viscous fluid with immersed deformable particles. We describe a parallel boundary integral equation solver for general elliptic partial differential equations, which we apply to Stokes flow through blood vessels. We also detail a parallel collision avoiding algorithm to ensure RBCs and the blood vessel remain contact-free. We have scaled our code on Stampede2 at the Texas Advanced Computing Center up to 34,816 cores. Our largest simulation enforces a contact-free state between four billion surface elements and solves for three billion degrees of freedom on one million RBCs and a blood vessel composed from two million patches."

      "description": "Eulerian Fluid Simulation is an effective formula of modeling fluid in many HPC applications. The high computational complexity of traditional solvers leads to limited deployment, while several neural-network-based methods reduce the labor of computation by learning complicated relationships and draw wide attention. However, these state-of-the-arts apply single network topology to this input-sensitive application, resulting in inability for achieving required accuracy or inefficiency for leveraging the power of machine learning.<br><br>In this work, we propose Smart-fluidnet, which provides various approximate models and enables adaptive approximation to accelerate fluid simulation. We generate multiple network typologies by designed transformation operations and select the most suitable models by offline output-quality controller, then a quality-aware runtime algorithm dynamically singles out the optimal one with ignorable runtime overhead. The results show that Smart-fluidnet is 46% and 590x faster than Tompson's method (the state-of-the-art neural network model) and original fluid simulation respectively on an NVIDIA Pascal GPU."

      "description": "This paper presents new advances in GPU-driven Fourier pseudo-spectral numerical algorithms, which allow the simulation of turbulent fluid flow at problem sizes which exceed the current state of the art. In contrast to several massively parallel petascale systems, the dense nodes of Summit, Sierra, and expected exascale machines can be exploited with coarser MPI decompositions which result in improved MPI all-to-all scaling. An asynchronous batching strategy, combined with the fast hardware connection between the large CPU memory and the fast GPUs allows effective use of the GPUs on problem sizes which are too large to reside in GPU memory. Communication performance is further improved by a hybrid MPI+OpenMP approach. Favorable performance is obtained up to a 18432^3 problem size on 3072 nodes of Summit, with a GPU to CPU speedup of 4.7 for a 12288^3 problem size (the largest problem size previously published in turbulence literature)."

      "description": "This talk presents the methods and procedures used to produce the first image of a black hole from the Event Horizon Telescope. It has been theorized for decades that a black hole will leave a \"shadow\" on a background of hot gas. Taking a picture of this black hole shadow could help to address a number of important scientific questions, both on the nature of black holes and the validity of general relativity. Unfortunately, due to its small size, traditional imaging approaches require an Earth-sized radio telescope. In this talk, I discuss techniques we have developed to photograph a black hole using the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), a network of telescopes scattered across the globe. Imaging a black hole\u2019s structure with this computational telescope requires us to reconstruct images from sparse measurements, heavily corrupted by atmospheric error. The resulting image is the distilled product of an observation campaign that collected approximately five petabytes of data over four evenings in 2017. The process for recording, correlating, calibrating, and imaging the data has been built-out by the EHT over the last decade. We will summarize how the data from the 2017 observations were calibrated and imaged, and we will explain some of the challenges that arise with a heterogeneous telescope array like the EHT."

And the current DEMs are only the beginning.  We now face an avalanche of imagery and derived products in an increasingly complex landscape of small-sats launched by the dozen.  It is a complex, exciting time."

      "description": "Large-batch training approaches have enabled researchers to utilize distributed processing and greatly accelerate deep neural networks training.  However, there are three problems in current large-batch research:<br><br>(1) Although RNN approaches like LSTM have been widely used in many applications, current large-batch research is principally focused on CNNs.<br><br>(2) Even for CNNs, there is no automated technique for  extending the batch size beyond 8K.<br><br>(3) To keep the variance in the gradient expectation constant, theory suggests that a Sqrt Scaling scheme should be used in large-batch training. <br><br>Unfortunately, there are not many successful applications.  In this paper, we propose Dynamic Adaptive-Tuning Engine (DATE) for better large-batch training.  DATE achieves a 5.3x average speedup over the baselines for four LSTM-based applications on the same hardware.  We finish the ImageNet training with ResNet-50 in two minutes on 1024 v3 TPUs (76.7% top-1 accuracy), which is the fastest version as of June 2019."

      "description": "Accelerating large-scale CNN training is needed to keep training times reasonable as datasets grow larger and models become more complex. Existing frameworks primarily scale using data-parallelism, but this is limited by the mini-batch size, which cannot grow arbitrarily. We introduce three algorithms that partition channel or filter data to exploit parallelism beyond the sample dimension. Further, they partition the parameters of convolutional layers, replacing global allreduces with segmented allreduces---smaller, concurrent allreduces among disjoint processor sets. These algorithms enable strong scaling, reduced communication overhead, and reduced memory pressure, enabling training of very wide CNNs.<br><br>We demonstrate improved strong and weak scaling, including up to 4.1x reductions in training time for residual networks and 4x reductions in allreduce overhead. We also show that wider models provide improved accuracy on ImageNet. We study the current limitations of our algorithms and provide a direction for future optimizations of large-scale deep learning frameworks."

      "description": "Applying machine learning techniques to the quickly growing data in science and industry requires highly-scalable algorithms.  Large datasets are most commonly processed when distributed across many nodes. Each node's contribution to the overall gradient is summed using a global allreduce.  This allreduce is the single communication and thus scalability bottleneck for most machine learning workloads.  We observe that frequently, many gradient values are (close to) zero, leading to sparse of sparsifyable communication.  To exploit this insight, we analyze, design, and implement a set of communication-efficient protocols for sparse and quantized input data, in conjunction with efficient machine learning algorithms which can leverage these primitives.  Our communication protocols generalize standard collective operations, by allowing processes to contribute sparse input data vectors.  Our library extends MPI to support features such as non-blocking (asynchronous) operations and low-precision data representation.  As such, SparCML provides the basis for future   highly-scalable machine learning frameworks."

While Ask.CI has gained traction in the year since its launch, attracting nearly 150,000 page views, hundreds of contributors, and worldwide participation, we are always seeking ways to grow our audience. We recently introduced \"locales\",  institution-specific subcategories where institutions/communities of practice can post FAQs relevant to their constituents. Participants in the Locales pilot will share experiences and future plans at the BoF."

We will present examples of Intel distribution for HPL use for various real life top500-class machines. For example, a system with two significantly different types of compute nodes with each subset using different interconnect. We will show simpler cases with only compute nodes having configuration differences. In all of these cases, it is possible to achieve combined HPL score. This abstract has a showcase and interactive parts and will be interesting to all who run HPL frequently."

      "description": "Traditional batch job schedulers adopt the Compact-and-Exclusive (CE) strategy, packing processes of a parallel job into as few compute nodes as possible.  While CE minimizes inter-node network communication, it often leads to self-contention among tasks of a resource-intensive application.  Recent studies have used virtual containers to balance CPU utilization and memory capacity across physical nodes, but the unbalanced use of memory bandwidth and the shared last-level cache is still under-investigated.<br><br>In this work, we propose Spread-n-Share (SNS), a batch scheduling strategy that automatically scales resource-bound applications out onto more nodes to alleviate their performance bottleneck, and co-locates jobs in a resource compatible manner.  We implement Uberun, a prototype scheduler to validate SNS, considering memory bandwidth and LLC capacity as two types of performance-critical shared resources.  Experimental results show that SNS improves the overall system throughput by 19.8% on average over CE, while achieving an average individual job speedup of 1.8%."

      "description": "The success of machine learning has prospered Machine-Learning-as-a-Service (MLaaS) -- deploying trained machine learning (ML) models in cloud to provide low latency inference services at scale. To meet latency Service-Level-Objective (SLO), judicious parallelization at both request and operation levels is utterly important. However, existing ML systems (e.g., Tensorflow) and cloud ML serving platforms (e.g., SageMaker) are SLO-agnostic and rely on users to manually configure the parallelism. To provide low latency ML serving, this paper proposes a swift machine learning serving scheduling framework with a novel Region-based Reinforcement Learning (RRL) approach. RRL can efficiently identify the optimal parallelism configuration under different workloads by estimating performance of similar configurations with that of the known ones. We both theoretically and experimentally show that the RRL approach can outperform state-of-the-art approaches by finding near optimal solutions over 8 times faster while reducing inference latency up to 79.0% and reducing SLO violation up to 49.9%."

      "description": "While performing distributed computations in today's cloud-based platforms, execution speed variations among compute nodes can significantly reduce the performance and create bottlenecks like stragglers. Coded computation techniques leverage coding theory to inject computational redundancy and mitigate stragglers in distributed computations. In this paper, we propose a scheduling strategy for coded computation called SlackSqueeze Coded Computation (S2C2). S2C2 squeezes the compute slack (i.e., overhead) that is built into the coded computing frameworks by efficiently assigning work for all fast and slow nodes according to their speeds and without needing to re-distribute data. We implement an LSTM-based speed prediction algorithm to predict speeds of compute nodes. We evaluate S2C2 on linear algebraic algorithms, gradient descent, graph ranking, and graph filtering algorithms. We demonstrate a 19% to 39% reduction in total computation latency using S2C2 compared to job replication and coded computation. We further show how S2C2 can be applied beyond matrix-vector multiplication."

      "description": "Block Floating Point (BFP) is a hybrid of floating-point and fixed-point arithmetic where a block of data is assigned a common exponent. We describe a new arithmetic unit that natively performs Block Floating Point for common matrix arithmetic operations and creates floating-point results. The BFP arithmetic unit supports several data formats with varying precision and range. BFP offers substantial power and area savings over traditional floating-point arithmetic units by trading off some precision. This new arithmetic unit has been implemented in the new family of 7nm FPGAs from Achronix. We cover the architecture and supported operations of the BFP unit. In this presentation, artificial intelligence and machine learning workloads are benchmarked to demonstrate the performance improvement and power savings of BFP as compared to half-precision (FP16) operations."

      "description": "In efforts to increase performance and reduce cost, modern low-diameter networks are designed for average case traffic and rely on non-minimal adaptive routing for network load-balancing when adversarial traffic patterns are encountered. Source adaptive routing is the predominant method for adaptive routing even though it presents many deficiencies related to making global decisions based solely on local information. In contrast, incremental adaptive routing, which performs an adaptive decision at every hop, is able to increase throughput and reduce latency by overcoming the deficiencies of source adaptive routing. We present two incremental adaptive routing algorithms for HyperX which are the first to be fully implementable in modern high-radix router architectures and interconnection network protocols. Using cycle accurate simulations of a 4096 node network, our evaluation shows these algorithms are able to exceed the performance of prior work by as much as 4x with synthetic traffic and 25% with 27-point stencil traffic."

      "description": "System noise can negatively impact the performance of HPC systems, and the interconnection network is one of the main factors contributing to this problem.  To mitigate this effect, adaptive routing sends packets on non-minimal paths if they are less congested.  However, while this may mitigate interference caused by congestion, it also generates more traffic since packets traverse additional hops, causing in turn congestion on other applications and on the application itself. In this paper, we first describe how to estimate network noise.  By following these guidelines, we show how noise can be reduced by using routing algorithms which select minimal paths with a higher probability.  We exploit this knowledge to design an algorithm which changes the probability of selecting minimal paths according to the application characteristics.  We validate our solution on microbenchmarks and real-world applications on two systems relying on a Dragonfly interconnection network, showing noise reduction and performance improvement."

      "description": "The Dragonfly network has been deployed in the current generation supercomputers and will be used in the next generation supercomputers.  The Universal Globally Adaptive Load-balance routing (UGAL) is the state-of-the-art routing scheme for Dragonfly. In this work, we show that the performance of the conventional UGAL can be further improved on many practical Dragonfly networks, especially the ones with a small number of groups, by customizing the paths used in UGAL for each topology. We develop a scheme to compute the custom sets of paths for each topology and compare the performance of our topology-custom UGAL routing (T-UGAL) with conventional UGAL. Our evaluation with different UGAL variations and different topologies demonstrates that by customizing the routes, T-UGAL offers significant improvements over UGAL on many practical Dragonfly networks in terms of both latency when the network is under low load and throughput when the network is under high load."

      "description": "Inter-thread communication is a vital performance indicator in shared-memory systems. Prior works on identifying inter-thread communication employed hardware simulators or binary instrumentation and suffered from inaccuracy or high overheads\u2014both space and time\u2014making them impractical for production use. We propose ComDetective, which produces communication matrices that are accurate and introduces low runtime and memory overheads, thus making it practical for production use.<br><br>ComDetective employs hardware performance counters to sample memory-access events and uses hardware debug registers to sample communicating pairs of threads. ComDetective can differentiate communication as true or false sharing between threads. Its runtime and memory overheads are only 1.30x and 1.27x, respectively, for the 18 applications studied under 500K sampling period. Using ComDetective, we produce insightful communication matrices for micro-benchmarks, PARSEC benchmark suite, and several CORAL applications and compare the generated matrices against MPI counterparts. Guided by ComDetective we optimize a few codes and achieve up to 13% speedup."

      "description": "Execution variance among different invocation instances of the same procedure is often an indicator of performance losses. On the one hand, instrumentation-based tools can insert calipers around procedures and identify execution variance; however, they can introduce high overheads. On the other hand, sampling-based tools insert no instrumentation and have low overheads; however, they cannot synchronize samples with procedure entry and exit.<br><br>In this paper, we propose FVSampler, a lightweight, sampling-based variance profiler. FVSampler employs hardware performance monitoring units in conjunction with hardware debug registers to sample and monitor whole procedure instances (invocation till return) and collect hardware metrics in each sampled procedure instance. FVSampler, typically, incurs only 6% runtime overhead and negligible memory overhead making it suitable for HPC-scale production codes. We evaluate FVSampler with several parallel applications and demonstrate its effectiveness in pinpointing execution variance. Guided by FVSampler, we tune data structures and algorithms to obtain significant speedups."

      "description": "Performance analysis is critical for eliminating scalability bottlenecks in parallel codes. There are many profiling tools that can instrument codes and gather performance data, but general, easy to use, and programmable analytics and visualization tools are limited. In this paper, we focus on the analytics of structured profiling data, such as that obtained from calling context trees or nested region timers in code. We present a set of techniques and operations that build on the pandas data analysis library to enable parallel profile analysis. We have implemented these techniques in a Python-based library called Hatchet, which allows structured data to be filtered, aggregated, and pruned.  Using performance datasets obtained from profiling parallel codes, we demonstrate how common performance analyses can be performed reproducibly with only a few lines of Hatchet code. Hatchet brings the power of modern data science tools to bear on performance analysis."

      "description": "The CUDA programming model was introduced in 2007 and featured a number of new concepts, such as occupancy and shared memory. In this work, we considered performance implications of these concepts in application to dense matrix factorizations. Our findings were contrarian to the widely accepted recommendations of the day. (i) We found a performance optimization pattern that leads to lower occupancy, whereas it was recommended to maximize occupancy in order to hide memory latencies. (ii) We found that instruction-level parallelism contributes to latency hiding on GPUs, which was believed to be not the case. (iii) We found that performance can be improved by using massive register blocking, whereas it was recommended to minimize register use to maximize occupancy. (iv) We found that shared memory is slower than registers and the use of the latter should be favored over the former, if possible. These novel insights led us to a design of the matrix multiply routine that substantially outperformed the state-of-the-art vendor BLAS library. The optimization pattern we pointed out is found today in many high-performance GPU codes."

In the area of diagnosing prostate cancer (PCa), which currently affects one in eight men, there is no well-accepted screening method for this important public health problem. In this presentation, we present an infrastructure that implement high performance computing resource to train and validate a proposed deep learning architecture to predict/detect the loci of prostate cancer by using a multi-parametric MRI (mp-MRI) prostate cancer dataset. The outcomes of the optimized deep learning model are further integrated into the web interface that can assist the radiologists in early prediction of PCa. Our tool has the potential to revolutionize the prostate cancer diagnosis and improve patient quality of life, while decreasing its cost by minimizing unnecessary prostate biopsies and surgeries."

Heart attack frequently strikes without warning and even expert cardiologists cannot tell, which of the potentially many initially small coronary plaques that almost invariably exist in all humans starting at their 2nd decade of life will remain stable. A small number of plaques will rupture, and even cause a heart attack. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging depicts plaque tissue at an unprecedented level of detail. Our approach employs deep learning to localize and quantify existing plaques and predict future plaque vulnerability using OCT image data. For heart disease treatment, we developed a mixture that can be injected to repair the heart after a myocardial infarction. We used a novel device that leverages AI to replicate transplanted cellular secretions. From these replicated secretions, we create a mixture that can be used to repair injured cardiac cells."

      "description": "GPU accelerators have become common on today\u2019s leadership-class computing platforms. Exploiting the additional parallelism offered by GPUs is fraught with challenges. A key performance challenge faced by developers is how to limit the time consumed by synchronization and memory transfers between the CPU and GPU. We introduce the feed-forward measurement (FFM) performance tool model that automates the identification of unnecessary or inefficient synchronization and memory transfer, providing an estimate of potential benefit if the problem were fixed. FFM uses a new multi-stage/multi-run instrumentation model that adjusts instrumentation based application behavior on prior runs, guiding FFM to problematic GPU operations that were previously unknown. The collected data feeds a new analysis model that gives an accurate estimate of potential benefit of fixing the problem. We created an implementation of FFM called Diogenes that we have used to identify problems in four real-world scientific applications."

      "description": "Recursive formulations of programs are straightforward to reason about and write, often have good locality properties, and readily expose parallelism. We observe that it is easier to automatically generate distributed-memory codes for recursive formulations with certain properties: i) inclusive\u2014a recursive method\u2019s parameters summarize the data access done within the method body. ii) Intersection\u2014data-set intersection tests among method invocations can be computed efficiently. <br><br>In this paper we present D2P, a system that automatically generates distributed-memory codes for recursive divide-conquer algorithms with these properties. D2P produces MPI-based implementations starting from shared-memory specifications of the recursive algorithms. We evaluate D2P with recursive Dynamic Programming (DP) algorithms, since these algorithms have the desired properties and are well known. We show that the generated implementations are scalable and efficient: D2P generated implementations execute faster than implementations generated by recent distributed DP frameworks, and are competitive with (and often faster than) hand-written implementations."

      "description": "NumPy is a popular Python library used for performing array-based numerical computations. The canonical implementation of NumPy used by most programmers runs on a single CPU core and is parallelized to use multiple cores for some operations. This restriction to a single-node CPU-only execution limits both the size of data that can be handled and the potential speed of NumPy code. In this work, we introduce Legate, a drop-in replacement for NumPy that requires only a single-line code change and can scale up to an arbitrary number of GPU accelerated nodes. Legate works by translating NumPy programs to the Legion programming model and then leverages the scalability of the Legion runtime system to distribute data and computations across an arbitrary sized machine. Compared to similar programs written in the distributed Dask array library in Python, Legate achieves speed-ups of up to 10x on 1280 CPUs and 100x on 256 GPUs."

      "description": "Nowadays, numerical simulation plays a vital role in analyzing and assessing various physical phenomena. Storage I/O performance and network bandwidth have not kept pace with the growth of computing power; as a result, post-processing has become a bottleneck to end-to-end simulation performance. GigaIO has developed a next generation network technology, FabreX, in order to address this challenge.  The presentation will describe how GigaIO partnered with SDSC to deploy and benchmark its solution using earthquake simulation as a representative problem. The presentation will discuss three approaches used to address this performance bottleneck: 1) Reducing the amount of output data by implementing in-situ visualization, which constructs the visualization concurrent with the running simulation; 2) Running the tests on a system utilizing the GigaIO\u2122 FabreX\u2122 next generation network solution; and (3) Using HPC resources provided by SDSC\u2019s Comet supercomputer to benchmark alternative approaches.<br><br>The presentation will describe how this project was impactful for both science (earthquake simulation platforms) and commerce (a new interconnect technology).  The partnership with SDSC permitted benchmarking the GigaIO technology in a laboratory environment against state-of-the-art production supercomputer resources, providing valuable feedback for GigaIO\u2019s product development efforts and validating a potential use case for the technology in modeling and simulation."

      "description": "Supercomputers have long been utilized in scientific fields in \u201ccapability\u201d fashion, i.e., for performing scale-resolved simulations in a short time. However, very few real-world applications have been demonstrated using a supercomputer in \u201ccapacity\u201d computing fashion, i.e., by running many high-fidelity simulations simultaneously. The presentation will demonstrate how an IBM Blue Gene/Q supercomputer at Argonne National Laboratory was utilized in \u201ccapacity\u201d fashion to optimize a heavy-duty engine running gasoline for improved efficiency. Combustion engines are extremely challenging to accurately simulate due to the disparate length and time scales, combined with a multitude of physical sub-processes (injection, evaporation, etc.), intertwined with complicated fuel and emission chemistry. A high-fidelity simulation approach was first developed and incorporated into the CONVERGE CFD code, and validated against experiments. A first-of-its-kind study was performed to guide engine design by exploring a large design space and operating range. Thousands of high-fidelity engine design combinations that would ordinarily require months on a typical cluster were simulated within days on Mira. The accelerated simulation time allowed the evaluation of an unprecedented number of variations within a short time span. Machine Learning was used to develop a surrogate model for the simulations using a \u201csuperlearner\u201d approach. This further offered the potential for reducing design time for subsequent iterations. Finally, significant fuel efficiency improvement and lower emissions were demonstrated using the real-world hardware recommended by the simulation. The ability to perform many high-fidelity calculations of a complex device on a supercomputer reduces time-to-science and opens a new frontier in the automotive industry."

      "description": "We propose COSMA: a parallel matrix-matrix multiplication algorithm that is near communication-optimal for all combinations of matrix dimensions, processor counts, and memory sizes. The key idea behind COSMA is to derive an optimal (up to a factor of 0.03% for 10MB of fast memory) sequential schedule and then parallelize it, preserving I/O optimality. To achieve this, we use the red-blue pebble game to precisely model MMM dependencies and derive a constructive and tight sequential and parallel I/O lower bound proofs. Compared to 2D or 3D algorithms, which fix processor decomposition upfront and then map it to the matrix dimensions, it reduces communication volume by up to sqrt{3}. COSMA outperforms the established ScaLAPACK, CARMA, and CTF algorithms in all scenarios up to 12.8x (2.2x on average), achieving up to 88% of Piz Daint's peak performance. Our work does not require any hand tuning and is maintained as an open source implementation."

      "description": "The discrete Fourier transform (DFT) is widely used in scientific and engineering computation. This paper proposes a template-based code generation framework named AutoFFT that can automatically generate high-performance fast Fourier transform (FFT) codes. AutoFFT employs the Cooley-Tukey FFT algorithm, which exploits the symmetric and periodic properties of the DFT matrix as the outer parallelization framework. To further reduce the number of floating-point operations of butterflies, we explore more symmetric and periodic properties of the DFT matrix and formulate two optimized calculation templates for prime and power-of-two radices. To fully exploit hardware resources, we encapsulate a series of optimizations in an assembly template optimizer. Given any DFT problem, AutoFFT automatically generates C FFT kernels using these two templates and transfers them to efficient assembly codes using the template optimizer. Experiments show that AutoFFT outperforms FFTW, ARMPL, and Intel MKL on average across all FFT types on ARMv8 and Intel x86-64 processors."

In this respect, it will serve as a replacement for ScaLAPACK, which after two decades of operation, cannot adequately be retrofitted for modern accelerated architectures.

      "description": "The US Department of Energy (DOE) has set a power target of 20-30MW on the first exascale machines. To achieve one exaflop under this power constraint, it is necessary to minimize wasteful consumption of power while striving to improve performance.  Toward this end, we investigate uncore frequency scaling (UFS) as a knob for reducing power footprints of HPC jobs. We propose Uncore Power Scavenger (UPSCavenger), a runtime system that dynamically detects phase changes and automatically sets the best uncore frequency for every phase to save power without significant impact on performance. Our experimental evaluations show that UPSCavenger achieves up to 10% energy savings with under 1% slowdown. It achieves 14% energy savings with the worst case slowdown of 5.5%. We show that UPSCavenger achieves up to 20% speedup and proportional energy savings compared to Intel\u2019s RAPL with equivalent power usage making it a viable solution even for power-constrained computing."

      "description": "Power budgeting (or capping) has become essential for large-scale computing installations.  As these systems scale out, they are able to concurrently execute dependent applications that were serially processed previously.  This reduces resource usage and execution time as they communicate at runtime instead of through disk.  One challenge for power budgeting systems is how to power cap dependent applications for high performance.  Existing approaches, however, have major limitations: (1) poor practicality, due to dependence on application profiles, (2) only optimize for power reallocation between nodes, without considering node-level optimization.<br><br>We propose PoDD -- a hierarchical, distributed, dynamic power management system for dependent applications. We implement it on a 49-node cluster and compare it to SLURM, a state-of-the-art power management system, but not considering coupling, and PowerShift, a power capping system for dependent applications without node-level optimization.  On average, PoDD increases performance over SLURM by 14-22%, over PowerShift by 11-13%."

      "description": "Probabilistic programming languages (PPLs) are receiving widespread attention for performing Bayesian inference in complex generative models. However, applications to science remain limited because of the impracticability of rewriting complex scientific simulators in a PPL, the computational cost of inference, and the lack of scalable implementations. To address these, we present a novel PPL framework that couples directly to existing scientific simulators through a cross-platform probabilistic execution protocol and provides Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and deep-learning-based inference compilation (IC) engines for tractable inference. To guide IC inference, we perform distributed training of a dynamic 3DCNN-LSTM architecture with a PyTorch-MPI-based framework on 1,024 32-core CPU nodes of the Cori supercomputer with a global minibatch size of 128k: achieving a performance of 450 Tflop/s through enhancements to PyTorch. We demonstrate a Large Hadron Collider (LHC) use-case with the C++ Sherpa simulator and achieve the largest-scale posterior inference in a Turing-complete PPL."

      "description": "As we near exascale, resilience remains a major technical hurdle. Any technique with the goal of achieving resilience suffers from having to be reactive, as failures can appear at any time. A wide body of research therefore aims at predicting failures, i.e., forecasting failures so that evasive actions can be taken while the system is still fully functional and enables a reasoning about its global state.<br><br>This research area has grown very diverse with a large number of approaches, yet is currently poorly classified, making it hard to understand  impact of existing work. In this paper, we perform an extensive survey of existing literature in failure prediction by analyzing and comparing more than 30 different failure prediction approaches. We develop a taxonomy, which aids in categorizing the approaches, and show how this can help to understand the state-of-the-practice of this field and identify opportunities, gaps as well as future work."

      "description": "Understanding the state-of-the-practice in MPI usage is paramount for many aspects of supercomputing, including optimizing the communication of HPC applications and informing standardization bodies and HPC systems procurements regarding the most important MPI features. Unfortunately, no previous study has characterized the use of MPI on applications at a significant scale; previous surveys focus either on small data samples or on MPI jobs of specific HPC centers. This paper presents the first comprehensive study of MPI usage in applications. We survey more than one hundred distinct MPI programs covering a significantly large space of the population of MPI applications. We focus on understanding the characteristics of MPI usage with respect to the most used features, code complexity, and programming models and languages. Our study corroborates certain findings previously reported on smaller data samples and presents a number of interesting, previously unreported insights."

      "description": "Productivity from day one on supercomputers that leverage new technologies requires significant preparation. The institution procuring a novel system architecture often does not have enough people with all the requisite knowledge and skills to prepare for it. Thus, institutions have recently employed the \"Center of Excellence\" (CoE) concept to prepare for systems such as Summit and Sierra, currently the top two systems in the Top 500. <br><br>This paper documents CoE experiences preparing a workload of diverse applications and math libraries for a heterogeneous system. We describe our approach to this preparation, including our management and execution strategies, and detail our experiences with and reasons for employing different programming approaches. Our early science and performance results show the project enabled significant early seismic science with up to a 14x throughput increase over Cori. In addition to our successes, we discuss our challenges and failures so others may benefit from our experience."

This inflection point for computing is creating a new wave of competition within the industry \u2013 and internationally. That competition is spurring a wave of innovation. The question is no longer \u2018if\u2019 but when and, more importantly shifts to what will be possible in this next great computational era. Regardless of who first breaks the tape, the new technologies and exotic engineering approaches are poised to provide immense industry benefits. The panel will discuss the unique innovations in the coming exascale systems based on an open platform approach, including new technical breakthroughs, software and programming tools, and the practical applications for HPC scenarios."

Texture mapping, multi-texture capabilities and frame buffer blending added a very small amount of programmability.  Vertex and pixel shaders added real programming \u2013 a primitive programming model, but highly parallel processing for many vertices and pixels.  The GPGPU movement recognized that GPUs were among the most powerful processors available, but very hard to program.  For GPUs to be generally useful, high level programming languages and features were needed.  Each step toward increasing capability required ideas, vision, and the hard work of many people who shared that vision.  A modern GPU is a mainstream processor that is pervasive and ubiquitous in HPC, data centers, gaming, and many other applications."

We had computational science and the third paradigm of scientific study. <br><br>Then came the World Wide Web and the programming on it leading the Grid computing initiative (1995-2010). I still remember a caustic referee report from those early days that HTTP was too slow to be serious. We learned in the OGF (Open Grid Forum) how to build communities and eScience was a key theme. Distributed computing was king and pleasing parallel was coined.<br><br>Then came a new revolution (2010-?) with Big Data and the fourth paradigm of computing built on data science as the academic underpinning. Distributed computing remained but the Grid metamorphosed as data processing in the edge and fog. Parallel computing still continues in exascale scientific discovery but also in parallel deep learning.<br><br>We muse about this progression noting some common themes -- natural high-level parallel programming remains hard, an area where I had the pleasure of joint research with Ken Kennedy -- and messaging is critical in many different scenarios. We look to a spectacular innovative future where deep learning. simulations and parallel computing synergistically run together; each enhances the other to orders of magnitude better capabilities and performance."

The thinking that carried the day was that you can hack hard enough, bring up performance, and earn your brownie points.  The Julia language, through abstractions and multiple dispatch technology, is making it possible to build supercomputing applications more readily in ways that can manage the complexities of modern supercomputers.  <br>     <br>We will explain how Julia is transforming HPC in such areas as Scientific Machine Learning, Climate Science, and Medicine.  We will conclude with the notion that the one true metric for HPC should not be performance; it should be the number of users. Performance, productivity, scalability, reproducibility, composability and other obvious and non-obvious metrics can then be subsumed by this \u201cprime directive\u201d."

      "description": "With ever-increasing volumes of data produced by large-scale scientific simulations, error-bounded lossy compression has come into a critical place. In this paper, we design a strategy to improve the compression quality significantly based on an optimized, hybrid prediction framework. The contribution is four-fold. (1) We propose a novel, transform-based predictor and optimize its compression quality. (2) We improve the coefficient-encoding efficiency for the data-fitting predictor. (3) We propose an adaptive framework that can select the bestfit predictor accurately for different datasets. (4) We perform the evaluation by running real-world applications on a supercomputer with 8192 cores. Experiments show that our adaptive compressor can improve the compression ratio by 112~165% over the second-best state-of-the-art lossy compressor. The parallel I/O performance is improved by about 100% because of significantly reduced data size. The total I/O time is reduced by up to 60x with our compressor compared with the original I/O time."

      "description": "The widely-used lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) for computational fluid dynamics is highly scalable, but also significantly memory bandwidth-bound on current architectures. This paper presents a new regularized LBM implementation that reduces the memory footprint by only storing macroscopic, moment-based data. We show that the amount of data that must be stored in memory during a simulation is reduced by up to 47%. We also present a technique for cache-aware data re-utilization and show that optimizing cache utilization to limit data motion results in a similar improvement in time to solution. These new algorithms are implemented in the hemodynamics solver HARVEY and demonstrated using both idealized and realistic biological geometries. We develop a performance model for the moment representation algorithm and evaluate the performance on Summit."

      "description": "We propose Slim Graph: the first programming model and framework for practical lossy graph compression that facilitates high-performance approximate graph processing, storage, and analytics. Slim Graph enables the developer to express numerous compression schemes using small and programmable compression kernels that can access and modify local parts of input graphs. Such kernels are executed in parallel by the underlying engine, isolating developers from complexities of parallel programming. Our kernels implement novel graph compression schemes that preserve numerous graph properties, for example connected components, minimum spanning trees, or graph spectra. Finally, Slim Graph uses statistical divergences and other metrics to analyze the accuracy of lossy graph compression. We illustrate both theoretically and empirically that Slim Graph accelerates numerous graph algorithms, reduces storage used by graph datasets, and ensures high accuracy of results. Slim Graph may become the common ground for developing, executing, and analyzing emerging lossy graph compression schemes."

Storage Class Memory (SCM), such as Intel\u2019s Optane DC Persistent Memory (DCPMM), offers applications byte-granular storage at higher bandwidths, lower latencies, and higher IOPs than solid state block storage devices alone.  DAOS stores its metadata and fine-grained application data to Optane DCPMM, and bulk data to NVMe storage (e.g. Optane or 3D-NAND SSDs).  In addition, DAOS provides transactional non-blocking I/O, OS bypass, advanced data protection with self-healing, end-to-end data integrity, fine grained data control, and fast data retrieval/indexing.  DAOS offers a unified storage model over domain-specific data models, such as HDF5, MPI-IO and Apache Spark, while supporting legacy applications through a POSIX emulation layer."

Traditionally astronomers have been taking pictures that, beautiful as they were, only observed tiny patches of a vast sky at specific moments in time. This is no longer the case, as astronomers have learned how to make whole sky movies. With these we have discovered a huge range of transient phenomena, and we have realized that we cannot explain them.  3D hydrodynamic simulations are one of the techniques used to determine the underlying mechanisms of this zoo of stellar interactions from supernovae to merging black holes.  I will talk about what 3DHD can give us, the techniques that we use (adaptive mesh, smooth particles hydrodynamics or moving mesh), the limitations they all have (lack of scalability), and possible solutions."

As demands for greater collaboration, more data analysis, more complex simulations, and computational power have grown in science, so have the challenges of developing and delivering robust CI to users. Sustainable and dependable CI is not developed in a vacuum; rather, it benefits from advances in Computer Science and provides a unique laboratory for Computer Science research.  Grounded in the challenging and ever-increasing needs of a multitude of scientific applications, CI is continuously enhanced and driven to innovate.  <br><br>This presentation examines selected modern scientific discoveries, such as the detection of gravitational waves from the CI perspective. It aims to answer the following key questions: first, what were the key CI solutions that enabled a particular scientific result? and second, what were the challenges that needed to be overcome? The CI examples will include science automation technologies, such as the Pegasus workflow management system and how it evolved over the last two decades as science applications and broader CI have grown in heterogeneity and scale.  It will describe the algorithms and solutions that enable the robust execution of complex scientific workflows on DOE and NSF-funded high-performance and high-throughput computing systems.<br><br>This talk will conclude with emerging challenges and opportunities in the CI landscape."

      "description": "State-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs) used in vision applications have large models with numerous weights. Training these models is very compute- and memory-resource intensive. Much research has been done on pruning or compressing these models to reduce the cost of inference, but little work has addressed the costs of training. We focus precisely on accelerating training. We propose PruneTrain, a cost-efficient mechanism that gradually reduces the training cost during training. PruneTrain uses a structured regularization approach that drives the training optimization toward both high accuracy and small weight values. Small weights can then be periodically removed by reconfiguring the network model to a smaller one. By using a structured-pruning approach and additional reconfiguration techniques we introduce, the pruned model can still be efficiently processed on a GPU accelerator. Overall, PruneTrain achieves a reduction of 39% in the training time of modern CNNs."

There is a growing need for the design and development of data-driven and, in particular, deep learning methods for various tasks such as cancer diagnosis, detection, prognosis, and prediction. For nonimage and nontext cancer data, designing high-performing deep learning models is a time-consuming, trial-and-error task that requires both cancer domain and deep learning expertise. We develop a reinforcement-learning-based neural architecture search to automate predictive model development for a class of representative cancer data. We develop custom building blocks that allow domain experts to incorporate the cancer-data-specific characteristics. We show that our approach discovers deep neural network architectures that have significantly fewer trainable parameters, shorter training time, and accuracy similar to or higher than those of manually designed architectures. We study and demonstrate the scalability of our approach on up to 1,024 Intel Knights Landing nodes of the Theta supercomputer at the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility."

In this paper, we provide an in-depth assessment of the systems' interconnects, that is based on Enhanced Data Rate (EDR) 100 Gb/s Mellanox Infiniband. Both systems use second-generation EDR Host Channel Adapters (HCAs) and switches adding several new features such as Adaptive Routing (AR), switch-based collectives, HCA-based tag matching, and NVMe-over-Fabrics offload. Although based on the same components, Summit's network is \"non-blocking'' (i.e., fully provisioned) and Sierra's network has a 2:1 taper. We evaluate the two systems' interconnects using traditional communication benchmarks as well as real applications. We find that the new Adaptive Routing dramatically improves performance, but the other new features still need improvement."

      "description": "The de-facto standard topology for modern HPC systems and data-centers are Folded Clos networks, commonly known as Fat-Trees. The number of network endpoints in these systems is steadily increasing. The switch radix increase is not keeping up, forcing an increased path length in these multi-level trees that will limit gains for latency-sensitive applications. Additionally, today's Fat-Trees force the extensive use of active optical cables which carries a prohibitive cost-structure at scale.<br><br>To tackle these issues, researchers proposed various low-diameter topologies, such as Dragonfly. Another novel, but only theoretically studied, option is the HyperX. We built the world's first 3 Pflop/s supercomputer with two separate networks, a 3-level Fat-Tree and a 12x8 HyperX. This dual-plane system allows us to perform a side-by-side comparison using a broad set of benchmarks. We show that the HyperX, together with our novel communication pattern-aware routing, can challenge the performance of, or even outperform, traditional Fat-Trees."

      "description": "As bytes-per-FLOP ratios continue to decline, communication is becoming a bottleneck for performance scaling. This paper describes bandwidth steering in HPC using emerging reconfigurable silicon photonic switches. We demonstrate that placing photonics in the lower layers of a hierarchical topology efficiently changes the connectivity and consequently allows operators to recover from system fragmentation that is otherwise hard to mitigate using common task placement strategies. Bandwidth steering enables efficient utilization of the higher layers of the topology and reduces cost with no performance penalties. In our simulations with a few thousand network endpoints, bandwidth steering reduces static power consumption per unit throughput by 36% and dynamic power consumption by 14% compared to a reference fat tree topology. Such improvements magnify as we taper the bandwidth of the upper network layer. In our hardware testbed, bandwidth steering improves total application execution time by 69%, unaffected by bandwidth tapering."

Over the past decade, cybercriminals have learned how to leverage the Internet for malicious intent. Modern cybersecurity solutions need to quickly and accurately determine the security risk of visiting a website by classifying the complex information found within long sequences of data.<br><br>Effective machine learning solutions handle this problem by learning patterns from arbitrarily long input sequences in a way that captures signals correlated to malicious activity. These sequence modeling approaches are computationally expensive, requiring either large amounts of memory to individually keep track of a huge number of relevant subsequence fragments, or expansive computing power to iteratively evaluate and update networks that model the sequence as a whole.<br><br>The Solution<br><br>We\u2019ve successfully used the resources at the San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC) to address these difficult computational challenges, making significant advances for cybersecurity solutions. We will walk conference attendees through our process and share real-life examples. For instance, the unique resources at SDSC made possible the training of our Real-Time Anti-Phishing model, which requires rapid random access across nearly a terabyte of data. The high-memory computing resources allow us to accelerate the random access bottleneck to speed up the training process several orders of magnitude, from days to minutes."

      "description": "IBM continues its innovation around new memory technologies with the recently developed Hybrid Memory Subsystem (HMS) adapter, enabling 3TB per card of persistent memory in today's POWER9 system.  Applications which require large memory footprints can utilize up to 24TB of load/store persistent memory in a 4 socket system, at a lower cost/GB than DRAM.  This is IBM's first storage class memory card leveraging the OpenCAPI 25GB/s high speed serial interface in existing IBM systems.  This presentation will cover the HMS architecture, software stack enablement around the standardized SNIA programming model and illustrate the benefits of persistent memory on a high speed serial interface.  Additionally, we will be demonstrating HMS in a system during the exhibit, showing real-world benefits not previously achievable."

      "description": "Recent advances in data generation technologies have provided the biological sciences with enormous resources for both DNA sequences and morphological measurements. These data have created entirely new fields and have facilitated our ability to address classic questions in biology that had previously been data-limited. However, despite these advances, new challenges have also emerged. For example, while biologists previously thought that simply increasing the available data would result in more accurate results, most new analyses have uncovered extensive underlying heterogeneity that result from biological processes.  Computational challenges have also limited our ability to take full advantage of the new resources.  Both the size of the datasets and the underlying complexity have dramatically hindered optimization and inference.  I will describe several of the computational challenges facing evolutionary biology along with several solutions.  I will also describe some of the limits to our ability to reconstruct the phylogenetic past, despite our enormous efforts."

      "description": "In recent years, many complex and challenging numerical problems, in areas such as climate modeling and earthquake simulation, have been efficiently resolved on Sunway TaihuLight, and have been successfully scaled to over 10 million cores with inspiringly good performance. To carefully deal with different issues such as computing efficiency, data locality, and data movement, novel optimizing techniques from different levels are proposed, including some specific ones that fit well with the unique architectural futures of the system and significantly improve the performance.  While the architectures for current- and next-generation supercomputers have already diverted, it is important to see the pro and cons of whatever we already have, and to make up the bottlenecks as well as maximize the advantages. This talk contains the summary of the most essential HPC solutions that greatly contribute to the performance boost in our efforts on porting geoscience applications, the discussions and rethinking, and the potential improvements we could undertake."

      "description": "Network congestion is one of the biggest problems facing HPC systems today, affecting system throughput, performance, user experience, and reproducibility. Congestion manifests as run-to-run variability due to contention for shared resources (like filesystems) or routes between compute endpoints. Despite its significance, current network benchmarks fail to proxy the real-world network utilization seen on congested systems. We propose a new open-source benchmark suite called the Global Performance and CongestionNetwork Tests (GPCNeT) to advance the state of the practice in this area. The guiding principles used in designing GPCNeT are described, and the methodology employed to maximize its utility is presented. The capabilities of GPCNeT evaluated by analyzing results from several world\u2019s largest HPC systems, including an evaluation of congestion management on a next-generation network.  The results show that systems of all technologies and scales are susceptible to congestion, and this work motivates the need for congestion control in next-generation networks."

      "description": "Communication cost is an important factor for applications on clusters and supercomputers. To improve communication performance, developers need tools that enable them to understand how their application\u2019s communication patterns interact with the network, especially when those interactions result in congestion. Since communication performance is difficult to reason about analytically and simulation is costly, measurement-based approaches are needed. This paper describes a new sampling-based technique to collect information about the path a packet takes and congestion it encounters. We describe a variant of this scheme that requires only 5\u20136 bits of information in a monitored packet, making it practical for use in next-generation networks. Simulations of synthetic benchmarks, miniGhost, and pF3D show that this strategy provides precise application-centric quantitative information about traffic and congestion that can be used to distinguish between problems with an application\u2019s communication patterns, its mapping onto a parallel system, and outside interference."

      "description": "Erasure Coding (EC) NIC offload is a promising technology for designing next-generation distributed storage systems. However, this paper has identified three major limitations of current-generation EC NIC offload schemes on modern SmartNICs. Thus, this paper proposes a new EC NIC offload paradigm based on the tripartite graph model, namely TriEC. TriEC supports both encode-and-send and receive-and-decode operations efficiently. Through theorem-based proofs, co-designs with memcached (i.e., TriEC-Cache), and extensive experiments, we show that TriEC is correct and can deliver better performance than the state-of-the-art EC NIC offload schemes (i.e., BiEC). Benchmark evaluations demonstrate that TriEC outperforms BiEC by up to 1.82x and 2.33x for encoding and recovering, respectively. With extended YCSB workloads, TriEC reduces the average write latency by up to 23.2% and the recovery time by up to 37.8%. TriEC outperforms BiEC by 1.32x for a full-node recovery with 8 million records."

      "description": "Although data partitioning is required to enable parallelism on distributed memory systems, data partitions are not first class objects in most distributed programming models. As a result, automatic parallelizers and application writers encode a particular partitioning strategy in the parallelized program, leading to a program not easily configured or composed with other parallel programs.<br><br>We present a constraint-based approach to automatic data partitioning. By introducing abstractions for first-class data partitions, we express a space of correct partitioning strategies. Candidate partitions are characterized by partitioning constraints, which can be automatically inferred from data accesses in parallelizable loops. Constraints can be satisfied by synthesized partitioning code or user-provided partitions. We demonstrate that programs auto-parallelized in our approach are easily composed with manually parallelized parts and have scalability comparable to hand-optimized counterparts."

      "description": "Many task-based graph algorithms benefit from executing tasks according to some priority order. To support such algorithms, graph frameworks use Concurrent Priority Schedulers (CPSs), which attempt to execute the tasks according to priority order.  While CPSs are critical to performance, there is insufficient insight on the relative strengths and weaknesses of the different CPS designs in the literature. Such insights would be invaluable to design better CPSs for graph processing.<br><br>This paper performs a detailed empirical performance analysis of several advanced CPS designs in a state-of-the-art graph analytics framework running on a large shared-memory server. Our analysis finds that all CPS designs but one impose major overheads that dominate running time. Only one CPS, the Galois' OBIM, typically imposes negligible overheads, but its performance is input-dependent and can melt down for some inputs.  Based on these insights, we develop PMOD that is both robust and delivers the highest performance overall."

      "description": "With task parallel models, programmers can easily parallelize divide-and-conquer algorithms by using nested fork-join structures. Work stealing, which is a popular scheduling strategy for task parallel programs, can efficiently perform dynamic load balancing; however, it tends to damage data locality and does not scale well with memory-bound applications. This paper introduces Almost Deterministic Work Stealing (ADWS), which addresses the issue of data locality of traditional work stealing by making the scheduling almost deterministic. Specifically, ADWS consists of two parts: (i) deterministic task allocation, which deterministically distributes tasks to workers based on the amount of work for each task, and (ii) hierarchical localized work stealing, which dynamically compensates load imbalance in a locality-aware manner. Experimental results show that ADWS is up to nearly 6 times faster than a traditional work stealing scheduler with memory-bound applications, and that dynamic load balancing works well while maintaining good data locality."

      "description": "Exploiting the numeric symmetry in sparse matrices to reduce their memory footprint is very tempting for optimizing the memory-bound Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication (SpMV) kernel. Despite being very beneficial for serial computation, storing the upper or lower triangular part of the matrix introduces race conditions in the updates to the output vector in a parallel execution. Previous work has suggested using local, per-thread vectors to circumvent this problem, introducing a work-inefficient reduction step that limits the scalability of SpMV. In this paper, we address this issue with Conflict-Free Symmetric (CFS) SpMV, an optimization strategy that organizes the parallel computation into phases of conflict-free execution. We identify such phases through graph coloring and propose heuristics to improve the coloring quality for SpMV in terms of load balancing and locality to the input and output vectors. We evaluate our approach on two multicore shared-memory systems and demonstrate improved performance over the state-of-the-art."

      "description": "The Compressed Sparse Fiber (CSF) representation for sparse tensors is a generalization of the Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) format for sparse matrices.  For a tensor with d modes, typical tensor methods such as CANDECOMP/PARAFAC decomposition (CPD) require a sequence of d tensor computations, where efficient memory access with respect to different modes is required for each of them.  The straightforward solution is to use d distinct representations of the tensor, with each one being efficient for one of the d computations.  However, a d-fold space overhead is often unacceptable in practice, especially with memory-constrained GPUs. <br><br>In this paper, we present a mixed-mode tensor representation that partitions the tensor's nonzero elements into disjoint sections, each of which is compressed to create fibers along a different mode.  Experimental results demonstrate that better performance can be achieved while utilizing only a small fraction of the space required to keep d distinct CSF representations."

      "description": "This work tackles the communication challenges posed by the latency-bound applications with irregular communication patterns, i.e., applications with high average and/or maximum message counts. We propose a novel algorithm for reorganizing a given set of irregular point-to-point messages with the objective of reducing total latency cost at the expense of increased volume. We organize processes into a virtual process topology inspired by the k-ary n-cube networks and regularize irregular messages by imposing regular communication pattern(s) onto them. Exploiting this process topology, we propose a flexible store-and-forward algorithm to control the trade-off between latency and volume. Our approach is able to reduce the communication time of sparse-matrix multiplication with latency-bound instances drastically: up to 22.6x for 16K processes on a 3D Torus network and up to 7.2x for 4K processes on a Dragonfly network, with its performance getting better with increasing number of processes."

More and more diverse user communities access heterogeneous and geographically distributed HPC resources (on-premises, private, and public Cloud), without necessarily being aware of them. This HPC democratization requires user-friendly web portals, science gateways, and web services to expose business related features and hide underlying technical complexity. Web interfaces are now a standard way to fulfill HPC end-users and administrators\u2019 needs from PCs as well as from mobile devices. The goal of this panel is to discuss the diverse user experiences (developers, computational experts, course instructors, unexperienced new comers) and the features they require. Different development and distribution approaches (open source or commercial software, products or services) will also be discussed. The panelists will conclude by sharing their vision on how the evolution of HPC usage will shape the future portals, web services, and related emerging standards."

      "description": "With accelerators being used to boost high-performance computing, FPGAs are increasingly popular options offering a reconfigurable datapath. Traditional FPGA architectures connect the external interfaces to the periphery beachfront of the FPGA fabric. But as FPGA compute capacity and external interface bandwidth continue to grow exponentially, the frequency for the FPGA logic and interconnect does not scale, leading to a mismatch in connecting the FPGA fabric to the outside world. An innovative Network-on-Chip (NoC) architecture, with a bi-sectional bandwidth of 20Tbps, addresses this issue. It allows external interface controllers to connect to each other, and gracefully moves data in, out, and around the FPGA fabric. The NoC overlays a 2D network of high-speed packet-based communication infrastructure providing 160 access points connecting into the FPGA fabric. Learn how 2D NoC improves performance and eases design by reducing routing congestion, eliminating floor-planning challenges, and decoupling clock domains."

      "description": "To improve programmability and productivity, recent GPUs adopt a virtual memory address space shared with CPUs (e.g., NVIDIA\u2019s unified memory). Unified memory migrates the data management burden from programmers to system software and hardware, and enables GPUs to address datasets that exceed their memory capacity. Our experiments show that while the implicit data transfer of unified memory may bring better data movement efficiency, page fault overhead and data thrashing can erase its benefits. In this paper, we propose several user-transparent unified memory management schemes to achieve adaptive implicit and explicit data transfer and prevent data thrashing. Unlike previous approaches which mostly rely on the runtime and thus su\ufb00er from large overhead, we demonstrate the benefits of exploiting key information from compiler analyses. We implement the proposed schemes to improve OpenMP GPU offloading performance. Our evaluation shows that our schemes improve the GPU performance and memory efficiency significantly."

In combination, these properties place immense demands on the memory hierarchy that limit performance. Blocking techniques like tiling are used to exploit reuse in cache. Additional fine-grain data blocking can also reduce TLB, hardware prefetch, and cache pressure. <br><br>In this paper, we present a code generation approach designed to further improve tiled stencil performance by exploiting reuse within the block, increasing instruction-level parallelism, and exposing opportunities for the backend compiler to eliminate redundant computation. It also enables efficient vector code generation for CPUs and GPUs. For a wide range of complex stencil computations, we are able to achieve substantial speedups over tiled baselines for Intel KNL and Skylake-X and Nvidia P100 architectures."

We formulate a systolic model that shifts partial sums by CUDA warp primitives for the computation. We also employ register files as a cache resource in order to operate the entire model efficiently. We demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed model for a wide variety of stencil kernels that appear commonly in HPC, and also convolution kernels (increasingly important in deep learning workloads). Our algorithm outperforms the top reported state-of-the-art stencil implementations, including implementations with sophisticated temporal and spatial blocking techniques, on the two latest Nvidia architectures: Tesla V100 and P100. For 2D convolution of general filter sizes and shapes, our algorithm is on average 2.5\u00d7 faster than Nvidia\u2019s NPP on V100 and P100 GPUs."

      "description": "The computational efficiency of a state of the art ab initio quantum transport (QT) solver, capable of revealing the coupled electrothermal properties of atomically-resolved nano-transistors, has been improved by up to two orders of magnitude through a data centric reorganization of the application. The approach yields coarse- and fine-grained data-movement characteristics that can be used for performance and communication modeling, communication avoidance, and dataflow transformations. The resulting code has been tuned for two top-6 hybrid supercomputers, reaching a sustained performance of 85.45 Pflop/s on 4,560 nodes of Summit (42.55% of the peak) in double precision, and 90.89 Pflop/s in mixed precision. These computational achievements enable the restructured QT simulator to treat realistic nanoelectronic devices made of more than 10,000 atoms within a 14\u00d7 shorter duration than the original code needs to handle a system with 1,000 atoms, on the same number of CPUs/GPUs and with the same physical accuracy."

      "description": "Accurate large-scale first principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) in metallic systems are prohibitively expensive due to the asymptotic cubic scaling computational complexity with number of electrons. Using algorithmic advances in employing finite-element discretization for DFT (DFT-FE) in conjunction with efficient computational methodologies and mixed precision strategies, we delay the onset of this cubic scaling by significantly reducing the computational prefactor while increasing the arithmetic intensity and lowering the data movement costs. This has enabled fast, accurate, and massively parallel DFT calculations on large-scale metallic systems on both many-core and heterogeneous architectures, with time-to-solution being an order of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art plane-wave DFT codes. We demonstrate an unprecedented sustained performance of 46 PFLOPS (27.8% peak FP64 performance) on a dislocation system in Magnesium containing 105,080 electrons using 3,800 GPU nodes of Summit supercomputer, which is the highest performance to date among DFT codes."

Since compute resources must be available when data arrives, these approaches provide deadline-based models of execution. This paper introduces a deadline-free general compute model for network endpoints called INCA: In-Network Compute Assistance. INCA builds upon contemporary NIC offload capabilities to provide on-NIC, deadline-free, general-purpose compute capacities that can be utilized when the network is inactive. We demonstrate INCA is Turing complete, and provide a detailed design for extending existing hardware to support this model. We evaluate runtimes for a selection of kernels, including several optimizations, and show INCA can provide up to a 11% speedup for applications with minimal code modifications and<br>between 25% to 37% when applications are optimized for INCA."

      "description": "Applications often communicate data that is non-contiguous in the send- or the receive-buffer, e.g., when exchanging a column of a matrix stored in row-major order. While non-contiguous transfers are well supported in HPC (e.g., MPI derived datatypes), they can still be up to 5x slower than contiguous transfers of the same size. As we enter the era of network acceleration, we need to investigate which tasks to offload to the NIC:  In this work we argue that non-contiguous memory transfers can be transparently network-accelerated, truly achieving zero-copy communications. We implement and extend sPIN, a packet streaming processor, within a Portals 4 NIC SST model, and evaluate strategies for NIC-offloaded processing of MPI datatypes, ranging from datatype-specific handlers to general solutions for any MPI datatype. We demonstrate up to 8x speedup in the unpack throughput of real applications, demonstrating that non-contiguous memory transfers are a first-class candidate for network acceleration."

Efficient simulation of these complex multiscale models on modern heterogeneous architectures poses significant challenges in scheduling and co-managing resources such as computational power, communication bottlenecks, and filesystem bandwidth. To address these challenges, we present a novel massively parallel Multiscale Machine-Learned Modeling Infrastructure (MuMMI), which combines a large length- and time-scale macro model with a high-fidelity molecular dynamics (MD) micro model using machine learning. We describe our infrastructure which is designed for high scalability, efficiency, robustness, portability, and fault tolerance on heterogeneous resources. We demonstrate MuMMI conducting the largest-of-its-kind simulation to investigate the dynamics of KRAS proteins in cancer initiation. Concurrently running up to 36,000 jobs on 16,000 GPUs and 176,000 CPU cores, we executed 120,000 MD simulations surpassing an aggregate simulation time of 200 milliseconds, orders of magnitude greater than comparable studies."

      "description": "As new architecture designs continue to boost the system performance with higher circuit density, shrinking process technology and near-threshold voltage operations, the hardware is projected to be more vulnerable to transient faults. Even though relatively infrequent, crashes due to transient faults are incredibly disruptive, and are unpredictable necessitating frequent check-pointing, which would incurs huge overhead. <br><br>In this paper, we present CARE, a light-weight and compiler-assisted technique to continue the execution of applications upon crash-causing errors. CARE repairs corrupted states by recomputing the data for the crashed architecture states on-the-fly. We evaluated CARE with 5 scientific workloads with up to 3072 cores. During the normal execution of applications, CARE incurs near-to-zero overheads, and can recover on an average 83.5% of crash-causing errors within ten of milliseconds. Moreover, due to such an effective error-recovery mechanism, frequent check-pointing can be relaxed into a relatively infrequent one, tremendously reducing the overheads."

      "description": "This article describes the development of automatic program generation technology to create scalable phase-field methods for material science applications.  To simulate the formation of microstructures in metal alloys, we employ an advanced, thermodynamically consistent phase-field method.  A state-of-the-art large-scale implementation of this model requires extensive, time-consuming, manual code optimization to achieve unprecedented fine mesh resolution.  Our new approach starts with an abstract description based on free-energy functionals which is formally transformed into a continuous PDE and discretized automatically to obtain a stencil-based time-stepping scheme.  Subsequently, an automatized performance engineering process generates highly optimized, performance-portable code for CPUs and GPUs.  We demonstrate the efficiency for real-world simulations on large-scale GPU-based (PizDaint) and CPU-based (SuperMUC-NG) supercomputers. Our technique simplifies program development and optimization for a wide class of models. We further outperform existing, manually optimized implementations as our code can be generated specifically for each phase-field model and hardware configuration."

      "description": "This talk will present and demonstrate the NASA funded open source initiative, OpenSpace, which is a tool for space and astronomy research and communication, as well as a platform for technical visualization research. OpenSpace is a scalable software platform that paves the path for the next generation of public outreach in immersive environments such as dome theaters and planetariums. It opens up the possibilities to dynamically load and visualize large scale data from HPC simulations, distributed data repositories, and data feeds from space craft instrumentation. The technical focus will be on interactive data visualization on clustered high-end GPUs and in the presentation a number of features will be described and demonstrated such as: globe browsing which enables contextualization of extreme resolution imagery of planetary surfaces, interactive visualization of large star fields e.g., 1 billion stars from the Gaia DR2 data release, and volumetric rendering of MHD simulations of coronal mass ejections and operational space weather forecasting. The presentation will conclude with a journey to the end of the observable universe and the big bang.  The project builds on a collaboration between Link\u00f6ping University, The American Museum of Natural History, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, New York University, University of Utah, and University of Vienna."

      "description": "Achieving predictive data science for physical systems requires a synergistic combination of data and physics-based models, as well as a critical need to quantify uncertainties. For many frontier science and engineering challenge problems, a purely data-focused perspective will fall short---these problems are characterized by complex multi-scale multi-physics dynamics, high-dimensional uncertain parameters that cannot be observed directly, and a need to issue predictions that go beyond the specific conditions where data may be available. Learning from data through the lens of models is a way to bring structure to an otherwise intractable problem: it is a way to respect physical constraints, to embed domain knowledge, to bring interpretability to results, and to endow the resulting predictions with quantified uncertainties. This talk highlights how physics-based models and data together unlock predictive modeling approaches through two examples: first, building a Digital Twin for structural health monitoring of an unmanned aerial vehicle, and second, learning low-dimensional models to speed up computational simulations for design of next-generation rocket engines."

      "description": "A merge tree is a topological summary of a real-valued function on a graph. Merge trees can be used to find stable features in the data, report the number of connected components above any threshold, or compute other topological descriptors.  A local-global merge tree provides a way of distributing a merge tree among multiple processors so that queries can be performed with minimal communication. While this makes them efficient in massively parallel setting, the only known algorithm for computing a local-global merge tree involves global reduction.<br><br>Motivated by applications in cosmological simulations, we consider a restricted version of the problem: we compute a local-global tree down to a threshold fixed by the user. We describe two algorithms for computing such a tree via only local exchanges between processors. We present a number of experiments that show the advantage of our method on different simulations."

      "description": "We present a kD tree-based parallel strategy for solving with a spacetime-adaptive approach a general class of partial differential equations. This approach is primarily motivated by the necessity of designing computational methodologies that can scale to leverage the availability of very large computing clusters (exascale and beyond). For evolution problems, the standard approach of decomposing the spatial domain is a powerful paradigm of parallelization. However, for a fixed spatial discretization, the efficiency of purely spatial domain decomposition degrades substantially beyond a threshold. To overcome this, we consider the time domain as an additional dimension and simultaneously solve for blocks of time (spacetime), instead of the standard approach of sequential time-stepping. Spacetime discretization includes natural incorporation a posterior error, full-time solution history, and removal of time-stepping constraints.  We present scalable algorithms to perform matrix and matrix-free computations on KD trees, and show scalability across 32K cores in Titan."

      "description": "We study the simulation of stellar mergers, which requires complex simulations with high computational demands. We have developed Octo-Tiger, a finite volume grid-based hydrodynamics simulation code with Adaptive Mesh Refinement which is unique in conserving both linear and angular momentum to machine precision. To face the challenge of increasingly complex, diverse, and heterogeneous HPC systems, Octo-Tiger relies on high-level programming abstractions. <br><br>We use HPX with its futurization capabilities to ensure scalability both between nodes and within, and present first results replacing MPI with libfabric achieving up to a 2.8x speedup.  We extend Octo-Tiger to heterogeneous GPU-accelerated supercomputers, demonstrating node-level performance and portability.  We show scalability up to full system runs on Piz Daint. For the scenario's maximum resolution, the compute-critical parts (hydrodynamics and gravity) achieve 68.1% parallel efficiency at 2048 nodes."

      "description": "Quantum computers are known to solve certain problems that are otherwise intractable for the best classical algorithms. However, quantum devices in the near-term are still yet to develop capabilities that can yield practical advantages. A more fruitful direction for near-term quantum devices is then to use them as \"sampling devices\" which allow for efficient sampling from probability distributions that are arguably hard to simulate using classical computers. <br><br>One such hard sampling task exists in the training of Boltzmann Machine, which is a versatile model of probabilistic neural network that finds applications in a variety of areas in machine learning. In particular, accurately computing the gradient during the training of a restricted Boltzmann Machine requires extensive sampling from the model distribution, which is costly. We will present two different lines of work that have been pursued by our team, one using quantum annealers and the other using gate-model quantum devices."

Beyond the mere thrill of reaching new heights in terms of computing power and the potential discoveries it entails, this new frontier also brings unprecedented challenges that organizations need to address. While preparing for this new deal, three important areas are worth focusing on. First, invest in accelerated computing: GPU, FPGA, Quantum processors \u2013 which are not that far down the road! \u2013 but also AI-accelerated HPC and Edge computing. Secondly, optimize data flows through a diverse storage strategy but also through a better knowledge of application IOs. Finally, keep in mind that these transitions will only be successful if users are in a position to nurture their skills set and acquire new ones, be it quantum programming or IO monitoring, for HPC remains a collective adventure."

      "description": "The I/O subsystem for the Summit supercomputer, No. 1 on the Top500 list, and its ecosystem of analysis platforms is composed of two distinct layers: the in-system layer and the center-wide parallel file system layer (PFS), Spider 3. The in-system layer uses node-local SSDs and provides 26.7 TB/s for reads, 9.7 TB/s for writes, and 4.6 billion IOPS to Summit. The Spider 3 PFS layer uses IBM\u2019s Spectrum ScaleTM and provides 2.5 TB/s and 2.6 million IOPS to Summit and other systems. While deploying them as two distinct layers was operationally efficient, it also presented usability challenges in terms of multiple mount points and lack of transparency in data movement. To address these challenges, we have developed novel end-to-end I/O solutions for the concerted use of the two storage layers. We present the I/O subsystem architecture, the end-to-end I/O solution space, their design considerations and our deployment experience."

      "description": "Today's HPC installations are highly-complex systems, and their complexity will only increase as we move to exascale and beyond. At each layer, from facilities to systems, from runtimes to applications, a wide range of tuning decisions must be made in order to achieve efficient operation. This, however, requires systematic and continuous monitoring of system and user data. While many insular solutions exist, a system for holistic and facility-wide monitoring is still lacking in the current HPC ecosystem.<br><br>In this paper we introduce DCDB, a comprehensive monitoring system capable of integrating data from all system levels. It is designed as a modular and highly-scalable framework based on a plugin infrastructure. All monitored data is aggregated at a distributed noSQL data store for analysis and cross-system correlation. We demonstrate the performance and scalability of DCDB, and describe two use cases in the area of energy management and characterization."

      "description": "Large-scale applications typically spend a significant fraction of their execution time performing I/O to a parallel storage system. However, with rapid progress in compute and storage system stack of large-scale systems, it is critical to investigate and update our understanding of the I/O behavior of large-scale applications. Toward that end, in this work, we monitor, collect, and analyze a year's worth of storage system data from the NERSC parallel storage system which serves NERSC's two largest supercomputers, Cori and Edison. We perform temporal, spatial, and correlative analysis of the system as a whole, and of individual I/O and metadata servers, and uncover surprising patterns which defy existing assumptions about HPC I/O and have important implications for future systems."

However, there are still challenges and opportunities in integration of the scientific discoveries and data-driven methods for hazards with the advances in technology and computing in a way that provides and enables different modalities of sensing and computing. Previously NSF-funded WIFIRE project took the first steps to tackle this problem with a goal to create an integrated system and services for wildfire monitoring, simulation, and response. Today, WIFIRE provides an end-to-end management infrastructure from the data sensing and collection to modeling efforts using a continuum of computing methods that integrate edge, cloud, and high-performance computing. Though this cyberinfrastructure, the WIFIRE project provides data driven knowledge for a wide range of public and private sector users enabling scientific, municipal, and educational use. <br><br>This talk will review some of our recent work on building this dynamic data driven cyberinfrastructure and impactful application solution architectures that showcase integration of a variety of existing technologies and collaborative expertise. The lessons learned on use of edge and cloud computing on top of high-speed networks, open data integrity, reproducibility through containerization, and the role of automated workflows and provenance will also be summarized."

      "description": "GROMACS is one of the most popular Molecular Dynamic (MD) applications and is widely used in the field of chemical and biomolecular system study. Similar to other MD applications, it is computationally demanding. Therefore, many high-performance platforms have been employed to accelerate it, such as the KNL, Cell Processor, GPU and so on. As the third fastest supercomputer in the world, the TaihuLight contains 40,960 SW26010 processors, and every processor is a typical many-core processor. To make full use of the superior computation ability of the TaihuLight, we port the GROMACS to the SW26010. Finally, we not only achieved the 60\u00d7 speedup in the hot spot kernel but also came up with a new useful strategy to accelerate the short-range interaction computation. This strategy could deal with the update conflict in the many-core processor acceleration without much performance hit. Besides SW26010, it could also be used in many other processors."

Previous work, however, has consisted of either proof-of-concept implementations of components, usually the range-limited force; full systems, but with much of the work shared by the host CPU; or prototype demonstrations, e.g., using OpenCL, that neither implement a whole system nor have competitive performance. In this paper, we present what we believe to be the first full-scale FPGA-based simulation engine, and show that its performance is competitive with a GPU (running Amber in an industrial production environment). The system features on-chip particle data storage and management, short- and long-range force evaluation, as well as bonded forces, motion update, and particle migration. Other contributions of this work include exploring numerous architectural trade-offs and analysis on various mappings schemes among particles/cells and the various on-chip compute units."

      "description": "With more attention attached to nuclear energy, the formation mechanism of the solute clusters precipitation within complex alloys becomes intriguing research in the embrittlement of nuclear reactor pressure vessel (RPV) steels. Such phenomenon can be simulated with atomic kinetic Monte Carlo (AKMC) software, which evaluates the interactions of solute atoms with point defects in metal alloys. In this paper, we propose OpenKMC to accelerate large-scale KMC simulations on Sunway many-core architecture. To overcome the constraints caused by complex many-core architecture, we employ six levels of optimization in OpenKMC: (1) a new efficient potential computation model; (2) a group reaction strategy for fast event selection; (3) a software cache strategy; (4) combined communication optimizations; (5) a Transcription-Translation-Transmission algorithm for many-core optimization; (6) vectorization acceleration. Experiments illustrate that our OpenKMC has high accuracy and good scalability of applying hundred-billion-atom simulation over 5.2 million cores with a performance of over 80.1% parallel efficiency."

      "description": "As machine learning (ML) becomes pervasive in high performance computing, ML has found its way into safety-critical domains (e.g., autonomous vehicles). Thus the reliability of ML has grown in importance. Specifically, failures of ML systems can have catastrophic consequences, and can occur due to soft errors, which are increasing in frequency due to system scaling. Therefore, we need to evaluate ML systems in the presence of soft errors.<br><br>In this work, we propose BinFI, an efficient fault injector (FI) for finding the safety-critical bits in ML applications. We find the widely-used ML computations are often monotonic. Thus we can approximate the error propagation behavior of a ML application as a monotonic function. BinFI uses a binary-search like FI technique to pinpoint the safety-critical bits (also measure the overall resilience). BinFI identifies 99.56% of safety-critical bits (with 99.63% precision) in the systems, which significantly outperforms random FI, with much lower costs."

      "description": "Timing errors are a growing concern for system resilience as technology continues to scale. It is problematic to use low-fidelity errors such as single-bit flips to model realistic timing errors. We address the lack of holistic methodology and tools for evaluating resilience of applications against timing errors. The proposed technique is able to rapidly inject high-fidelity and configurable timing errors to applications at the instruction level. Our implementation has no runtime dependencies on proprietary tools, enabling full parallelism of error injection campaign. Furthermore, because an injection point may not generate an actual error for a particular application run, we propose an acceleration technique to maximize the likelihood of generating errors that contribute to the overall campaign with speedup up to 7x. With our tool, we show that realistic timing errors lead to distinct error profiles from those of radiation-induced errors at both the instruction level and the application level."

      "description": "Introspective sorting is a ubiquitous sorting algorithm which underlies many large scale distributed systems. Hardware-mediated soft errors can result in comparison and memory errors, and thus cause introsort to generate incorrect output, which in turn disrupts systems built upon introsort; hence, it is critical to incorporate fault tolerance capability within introsort. This paper proposes the first theoretically-sound, practical fault tolerant introsort with negligible overhead: FT-iSort. To tolerate comparison errors, we use minimal TMR protection via exploiting the properties of the effects of soft errors on introsort. This algorithm-based selective protection incurs far less overhead than na\u00efve TMR protection designed to protect an entire application. To tolerate memory errors that escape DRAM error correcting code, we propose XOR-based re-execution. We incorporate our fault tolerance method into the well-known parallel sorting implementation HykSort, and we find that fault tolerant HykSort incurs negligible overhead and obtains nearly the same scalability as unprotected HykSort."

These early adopter sites have already deployed these systems into production and are collecting a valuable repository of performance data. What to do with this wealth of data, how to process and analyze it, and how to feed it back into improved operations, will be the topic of this BoF session."

Coding standards in automotive and cybersecurity (e.g. CWE, MISRA) provide developers with rules and recommendations to prevent faulty code patterns. The ever-increasing complexity of HPC software and hardware pushes the developers to critically reevaluate testing methods, but there is no coding standard for parallel programming yet. Our goal is to form a community interested in quality assurance and best practices for parallel programming."

Querying common string indexes such as suffix arrays, enhanced suffix arrays, and FM-Index, all require random accesses into O(n) memory - which in distributed memory algorithms becomes prohibitively expensive.<br><br>In this paper, we introduce a novel distributed string index, the Distributed Enhanced Suffix Array (DESA).

      "description": "Community detection in graphs is a canonical social network analysis method. We consider the problem of generating suites of terascale synthetic social networks to compare the solution quality of parallel community-detection methods. The standard method, based on the graph generator of Lancichinetti, Fortunato, and Radicchi (LFR), has been used extensively for modest-scale graphs, but has inherent scalability limitations. <br><br>We provide an alternative, based on the scalable Block Two-Level Erdos-Renyi (BTER) graph generator, that enables HPC-scale evaluation of solution quality in the style of LFR.  Our approach varies community coherence, and retains other important properties. Our methods can scale real-world networks, e.g., to create a version of the Friendster network that is 512 times larger. With BTER's inherent scalability, we can generate a 15-terabyte graph (4.6B vertices, 925B edges) in just over one minute.  We demonstrate our capability by showing that label-propagation community-detection algorithm can be strong-scaled with negligible solution-quality loss."

      "description": "Data movement between processor and memory hierarchy is a fundamental bottleneck that limits the performance of many applications on modern computer architectures. Tiling and loop permutation are key techniques for improving data locality. However, selecting effective tile-sizes and loop permutations is particularly challenging for tensor contractions due to the large number of loops. Even state-of-the-art compilers usually produce sub-optimal tile-sizes and loop permutations, as they rely on na\u00efve cost models. In this paper, we provide an analytical model based approach to multi-level tile size optimization and permutation selection for tensor contractions. Our experimental results show that this approach achieves comparable or better performance than state-of-the-art frameworks and libraries for tensor contractions."

      "description": "Oil and Gas industry is continuously challenged to increase its hydrocarbon production in response to the growing demand for energy. Finding new oil and gas fields has become more challenging as resources are no longer easily accessible with an increase of geological complexity and environmental constraints. High-resolution and reliable subsurface imaging is getting more and more key for any oil and gas company to reduce the risk of seismic exploration, as well as estimating extractable hydrocarbon volumes. Since seismic imaging of complex geological structures requires extremely compute intensive algorithms and huge amount of data storage, HPC has a critical role in the process of seismic exploration, even more now with the emergence of promising AI algorithms. Therefore, Oil and Gas companies have often been pioneers in giant HPC cluster installation and will continue to dominate the industrial supercomputer market. For the new generation of systems, disruptive accelerated technology brings the mandatory computing power to be able to run higher resolution algorithms and to process richer data coming from the seismic acquisition, while reducing simulation times and energy costs. To tackle its technical and business challenges, including the integration of AI solutions, Total installed one of the most powerful supercomputers based on IBM Power9 and NVIDIA GPU technologies, called PANGEA III. In this presentation, we outline HPC key role in exploration and explain the choice of this new technology and how the solution matters in term of simulation and businesses improvement, as well as HPC application engineering and innovations."

      "description": "Application of AI in digital pathology has attracted increasing attention in recent years.<br>As the field is in its nascent days, there are numerous challenges in methodology to overcome. One of the main challenges is the extreme spatial dimension of digital whole slide images (WSIs), often larger than billion pixels. Although compute accelerator such as GPU significantly speeds up deep neural network training, its rather limited memory cannot accommodate large image inputs such as WSIs. The most prevalent solution to this problem is patch-based approach that divides WSIs into small image inputs. However, this method has significant drawbacks, most notably the laborious process to perform detailed annotation to provide ground truth for individual patches. Our solution to this problem is to utilize CUDA Unified Memory to allow DNN training on entire WSI inputs. Leveraging the HPC power of TAIWANIA 2, along with our proposed memory optimization techniques, we\u2019re able to train a DNN on 1000 WSIs to reach maximum performance (0.99 AUROC) in 16 hours, with 550x speedup on a total of 128 GPUs. Our experience on the Nasopharyngenl Carcinoma detection case, in collaboration with Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, shows this brand-new training pipeline could significantly shorten the production cycle. By reducing 6 months of annotation efforts, the method only takes 2 weeks to train a DNN model without accuracy loss. Our optimization, combined with HPC, resulted in an easily scalable solution that will greatly facilitate the development of digital pathology AI."

      "description": "In recent years, solid state drives (SSDs) have become a staple of high-performance data centers for their speed and energy efficiency. In this work, we study the failure characteristics of 30,000 drives from a Google data center spanning six years. We characterize the workload conditions that lead to failures and illustrate that their root causes differ from common expectation but remain difficult to discern. Particularly, we study failure incidents that result in manual intervention from the repair  process. We observe high levels of infant mortality and characterize the differences between infant  and non-infant failures. We develop several machine learning failure prediction models that are  shown to be surprisingly accurate, achieving high recall and low false positive rates. These models are used beyond simple prediction as they aid us to untangle the complex interaction of workload  characteristics that lead to failures and identify failure root causes from monitored symptoms."

      "description": "Memory and I/O performance bottlenecks in supercomputing simulations are two key challenges that must be addressed on the road to Exascale. The new byte-addressable persistent non-volatile memory technology from Intel, DCPMM, promises to be an exciting opportunity to break with the status quo, with unprecedented levels of capacity at near-DRAM speeds. Here, we explore the potential of DCPMM in the context of two high-performance scientific applications in terms of outright performance, efficiency and usability for both its Memory and App Direct modes. In Memory mode, we show equivalent performance and better efficiency for a CASTEP simulation that is limited by memory capacity on conventional DRAM-only systems without any changes to the application. For IFS, we demonstrate that a distributed object-store over NVRAM reduces the data contention created in weather forecasting data producer-consumer workflows. In addition, we also present the achievable memory bandwidth performance using STREAM."

To shed light on this issue in currently fabricated FinFETs, a quantum mechanical solver capable of revealing atomically-resolved electron and phonon transport phenomena from first-principles is required. <br><br>In this paper, we consider a global, data-centric view of a state-of-the-art quantum transport simulator to optimize its execution on supercomputers. The approach yields coarse- and fine-grained data-movement characteristics, which are used for performance and communication modeling, communication-avoidance, and data-layout transformations. The transformations are tuned for the Piz Daint and Summit supercomputers, where each platform requires different caching and fusion strategies to perform optimally. The presented results make ab initio device simulation enter a new era, where nanostructures composed of over 10,000 atoms can be investigated at an unprecedented level of accuracy, paving the way for better heat management in next-generation ICs."

However, it can be thousands of times more expensive than a conventional ground state DFT simulation, hence is limited to small systems. In this paper, we accelerate hybrid functional rt-TDDFT calculations using the parallel transport gauge formalism, and the GPU implementation on Summit. Our implementation can efficiently scale to 786 GPUs for a large system with 1536 silicon atoms, and the wall clock time is only 1.5 hours per femtosecond. This unprecedented speed enables the simulation of large systems with more than 1000 atoms using rt-TDDFT and hybrid functional."

      "description": "Quantum circuit simulations are critical for evaluating quantum algorithms and machines. However, the number of state amplitudes required for full simulation increases exponentially with the number of qubits. In this study, we leverage data compression to reduce memory requirements, trading computation time and fidelity for memory space. Specifically, we develop a hybrid solution by combining the lossless compression and our tailored lossy compression method with adaptive error bounds at each timestep of the simulation. Our approach optimizes for compression speed and makes sure that errors due to lossy compression are uncorrelated, an important property for comparing simulation output with physical machines.<br><br>Experiments show that our approach reduces the memory requirement of simulating the 61-qubit Grover's search algorithm from 32 exabytes to 768 terabytes of memory on  Argonne's Theta supercomputer using 4,096 nodes. The results suggest that our techniques can increase the simulation size by 2~16 qubits for general quantum circuits."

      "description": "The U.S. automotive industry spray-applied over 60 million gallons of paint in 2014.  Much of this paint is applied by an electrostatic rotary bell atomizer. Commonly used bells are capable of applying paint at 20% higher throughput compared to traditional gun atomizers. In these systems, desirable atomization, which controls paint appearance and the frequency of defects such as solvent pop and paint sag, suffers when fluid delivery is increased. To improve on this performance, new fundamental understanding of the relationships between fluid material properties, the atomization process, and the quality and performance of the resulting sprays is needed. <br><br>In a U.S Department of Energy HPC4Mfg collaboration between PPG and LBNL, we are developing computational models to explore paint behavior during rotary bell atomization as a function of paint fluid properties. In this collaborative effort, coating and experimental know-how within PPG are being combined with numerical modelling expertise and supercomputing capabilities at LBNL to advance understanding in this high value space. With this information, new coatings that atomize well at higher flow rates can be developed to increase productivity and ultimately reduce booth size. These improvements can deliver significant energy savings and enhance manufacturing competitiveness."

You could rely on a Disaster Recover (DR) plan, but having a complete mirror can be cost-prohibitive in both physical hardware and systems management - especially if your back-up site isn\u2019t really geared-up for HPC.  So why not try public cloud?  That\u2019s what the team at the University of Liverpool decided to do. They were searching for a means to keep resources available during the move of the Barkla HPC cluster, a 5,000-core Dell EMC cluster containing Xeon Phi and Nvidia Tesla V100 GPUs, into its updated facilities at the Department for Advanced Computing, an on-site data center located on the university campus.  This move, and the prospective downtime period of up to two weeks that would come with it, sparked the need to completely overhaul how the team approached HPC resource management when a 'planned disaster' was on the way - and their secondary on-site facility not built to handle the HPC workload at the required level for that duration.  The solution?  Lean on the ephemeral strength of not one, but two public cloud platforms (AWS and Microsoft Azure) to architect a mission critical variant of Barkla that would not only cover off the cluster move, but also ensure users had (nearly) seamless access to cloud resources, lay the foundation for cloud bursting projects, and create a stronger, long-term DR process for their HPC facilities."

To maintain performance portability in the future, it is imperative to decouple architecture-specific programming paradigms from the underlying scientific computations.<br><br>We present the Stateful DataFlow multiGraph (SDFG), a data-centric intermediate representation that enables separating program definition from its optimization. By combining fine-grained data dependencies with high-level control-flow, SDFGs are both expressive and amenable to program transformations, such as tiling and double-buffering. These transformations are applied to the SDFG in an interactive process, using extensible pattern matching, graph rewriting, and a graphical user interface. We demonstrate SDFGs on CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs over various motifs --- from fundamental computational kernels to graph analytics. We show that SDFGs deliver competitive performance, allowing domain scientists to develop applications naturally and port them to approach peak hardware performance without modifying the original scientific code."

When FPGAs are deployed in distributed settings, communication is typically handled either by going through the host machine, sacrificing performance, or by streaming across fixed device-to-device connections, sacrificing flexibility.  <br><br>We present Streaming Message Interface (SMI), a communication model and API that unifies explicit message passing with a hardware-oriented programming model, facilitating minimal-overhead, flexible, and productive inter-FPGA communication.  Instead of bulk transmission, messages are streamed across the network during computation, allowing communication to be seamlessly integrated into pipelined designs.  We present a high-level synthesis implementation of SMI targeting a dedicated FPGA interconnect, exposing runtime-configurable routing with support for arbitrary network topologies, and implement a set of distributed memory benchmarks.   Using SMI, programmers can implement distributed, scalable HPC programs on reconfigurable hardware, without deviating from best practices for hardware design."

TensorFlow and Cloud TPU framework enable the simple and readable code to express the complicated distributed algorithm without compromising the performance. Our code implementation fits into a small Jupyter Notebook and fully utilizes Cloud TPU's efficient matrix operation and dedicated high speed inter-chip connection. The performance is highly competitive: it outperforms the best published benchmarks to our knowledge by 60% in single-core and 250% in multi-core with good linear scaling. When compared to Tesla V100 GPU, the single-core performance maintains a ~10% gain.  We also demonstrate that using low precision arithmetic---bfloat16---does not compromise the correctness of the simulation results."

We propose a novel back-projection algorithm that reduces the projection computation cost to 1/6 of the standard algorithm. We also propose an efficient implementation that takes advantage of the heterogeneity of GPU-accelerated systems by overlapping the filtering and back-projection stages on CPUs and GPUs, respectively. Finally, we propose a distributed framework for high-resolution image reconstruction on state-of-the-art GPU-accelerated supercomputers. The framework relies on an elaborate interleave of MPI collective communication steps to achieve scalable communication. Evaluation on a single Tesla V100 GPU demonstrates that our back-projection kernel performs up to 1.6 times faster than the standard FDK implementation. We also demonstrate the scalability and instantaneous CT capability of the distributed framework by using up to 2,048 V100 GPUs to solve a 4K and 8K problems within 30 seconds and 2 minutes, respectively (including I/O)."

      "description": "X-ray computed tomography (CT) is used regularly at synchrotrons to study the internal morphology of materials at high resolution. However, experimental constraints, such as radiation sensitivity, can result in noisy or undersampled measurements. Further, depending on the resolution, sample size and data acquisition rates, the resulting noisy dataset can be terabyte-scale. Advanced iterative reconstruction techniques can produce high-quality images from noisy measurements, but their computational requirements have made their use exception rather than the rule. We propose here a novel memory-centric approach that avoids redundant computations at the expense of additional memory complexity. We develop a system, MemXCT, that uses an optimized SpMV implementation with multi-stage buffering and two-level pseudo-Hilbert ordering. We evaluate MemXCT on both KNL and GPUs architectures. MemXCT can reconstruct a large (11Kx11K) mouse brain tomogram in ~10 seconds using 4,096 KNL nodes (256K cores), the largest iterative reconstruction achieved in near-real time."

      "description": "Computed tomography (CT) image reconstruction is a crucial technique for many imaging applications. Among various reconstruction methods, Model-Based Iterative Reconstruction (MBIR) enables super-resolution with superior image quality. MBIR, however, has a high memory requirement that limits the achievable image resolution, and the parallelization for MBIR suffers from limited scalability. In this paper, we propose Asynchronous Consensus MBIR (AC-MBIR) that uses Consensus Equilibrium (CE) to provide a super-resolution algorithm with a small memory footprint, low communication overhead and a high scalability. Super-resolution experiments show that AC-MBIR has a 6.8 times smaller memory footprint and 16 times more scalability, compared with the state-of-the-art MBIR implementation, and maintains a 100% strong scaling efficiency at 146880 cores. In addition, AC-MBIR achieves an average bandwidth of 3.5 petabytes per second at 587,520 cores."

This is evident in multiple projects and initiatives such as the Campus Champions, ACI-REF, Research Software Engineer (RSE) communities as well as institutes such as the Science Gateways Community Institute. A major concern in achieving research computing sustainability is improving career paths for facilitators, RSEs, and/or science gateway creators - whether they are staff or faculty. Multiple initiatives and projects are trying to improve the situation, but the interaction between these initiatives is still sparse. While PIs, senior personnel, or organizers of such projects are often involved in at least one other project, there is not a systematic way yet for the organizations to collaborate. This is a good time to join forces and the panel will discuss questions such as \"What are good ways to complement actions between these projects and initiatives?\""

      "description": "As applications move toward extreme scales, data-related challenges are becoming significant concerns, and in-situ workflows based on data staging and in-situ/in-transit data processing have been proposed to address these challenges.  Increasing scales are also expected to result in an increase in the rate of silent data corruption errors, which will impact both the correctness and performance of applications.  Furthermore, this impact is amplified in the case of in-situ workflows due to the dataflow between the component applications of the workflow.  While existing research has explored silent error detection at the application level, silent error detection for workflows remains an open challenge. <br><br>This paper addresses error detection for extreme scale in-situ workflows.  The presented approach leverages the idle computation resource in data staging to enable timely detection and recovery from silent data corruption, effectively reducing the propagation of corrupted data and end-to-end workflow execution time in the presence of silent errors."

The parallel file system is typically centralized, and its storage media are physically separated from the compute cluster. Compute nodes as clients of the parallel file system are often additionally equipped with SSDs. The node internal storage media are rarely well-integrated into the I/O and compute workflows.<br><br>In this paper, we propose a hierarchical Persistent Client Caching (LPCC) mechanism for the Lustre file system. LPCC integrates with the Lustre HSM solution and the Lustre layout lock mechanism to provide consistent persistent caching services for I/O applications running on client nodes, meanwhile maintaining a global unified namespace of the entire Lustre file system for distributed persistent client caching. The evaluation results presented in this paper show LPCC's advantages for various workloads, enabling even speed-ups linear in the number of clients for several real-world scenarios."

      "description": "This paper revisits replication coupled with checkpointing for fail-stop errors. Previously published works use replication with the no-restart strategy: (i) compute the application Mean Time To Interruption M as a function of the number of processor pairs and the individual processor MTBF (Mean Time To Failures); (ii) use checkpointing period P= sqrt{2 M C}, where C is the checkpoint duration; and (iii) never restart failed processors until the application crashes. We introduce the restart strategy, where failed processors are restarted after each checkpoint, which may introduce an additional overhead but prevents the application configuration from degrading throughout successive checkpointing periods. We show how to compute the optimal checkpointing period P' for this restart strategy, and prove that its length is an order of magnitude higher than P. Furthermore, we show through simulations that using P' and the restart strategy significantly decreases the overhead induced by replication."

Yet, the promise of quantum computing is huge, and it could lead to several break-throughs in science, technology, and industry. Quantum algorithms are fundamentally different and provide a different way of thinking that can also applied to classical computing systems where we can use them today. We propose to bring the community of industry and academic researchers and users together to discuss recent results and ideas for the way forward."

      "description": "The ability for applications to achieve both portability and high performance across computer architectures remains an open challenge.  It is often unrealistic or undesirable for developers to maintain separate implementations for each target architecture, yet in many cases, achieving high performance and fully utilizing an architecture\u2019s underlying features requires the use of specialized language constructs and libraries. Likewise, abstractions and standards that promise portability cannot necessarily deliver high performance without additional algorithmic considerations, and performance compromises are often made to remain portable.  Application developers, who strive to work productively while balancing these concerns, often find the goal to be elusive. <br><br>There is a clear need to develop ways of managing the complexity that arises from system diversity that balance the need for performant specializations with the economy of appropriate and efficient abstractions.  Despite growth in the number of available architectures, there are similarities that represent general trends in current and emerging HPC hardware: increased thread parallelism; wider vector units; specialized hardware units; and deep, complex, memory hierarchies.  This in turn offers some hope for common programming techniques and language support as community experience matures.<br><br>The purpose of this workshop is to provide an opportunity for attendees to share ideas, practical experiences, and methodologies for tackling the challenge of achieving performance portability and developer productivity across current and future homogeneous and heterogeneous computer architectures."

      "description": "Previous studies into performance portability have typically analysed a single application (and its various implementations) in isolation. In this study we explore the wider landscape of performance portability by considering a number of applications from across the space of dwarfs, written in multiple parallel programming models, and across a diverse set of architectures. We apply rigorous performance portability metrics, as defined by Pennycook et al [Pennycook2016]. We believe this is the broadest and most rigorous performance portability study to date, representing a far reaching exploration of the state of performance portability that is achievable today. We will present a summary of the performance portability of each application and programming model across our diverge range of twelve computer architectures, including six different server CPUs from five different vendors, five different GPUs from two different vendors, and one vector architecture. We will conclude with an analysis of the performance portability of key programming models in general, across different application spaces as well across differing architectures, allowing us to comment on more general performance portability principles."

We present a detailed performance analysis, calculate performance portability and code divergence metrics, contrasting performance, portability, and productivity."

      "description": "Diversity among supported architectures in current and emerging high performance computing systems, including those for exascale, makes portable codebases desirable. Portability of a codebase can be improved using a performance portability layer to provide access to multiple underlying programming models through a single interface. Direct adoption of a performance portability layer, however, poses challenges for large pre-existing software frameworks that may need to preserve legacy code and/or adopt other programming models in the future. This paper describes an approach for indirect adoption that introduces a framework-specific portability layer between the application developer and the adopted performance portability layer to help improve legacy code support and long-term portability for future architectures and programming models. This intermediate layer uses loop-level, application-level, and build-level components to ease adoption of a performance portability layer in large legacy codebases. Results are shown for two challenging case studies using this approach to make portable use of OpenMP and CUDA via Kokkos in an asynchronous many-task runtime system, Uintah. These results show performance improvements up to 2.7x when refactoring for portability and 2.6x when more efficiently using a node. Good strong-scaling to 442,368 threads across 1,728 Knights Landing processors are also shown using MPI+Kokkos at scale."

This paper describes the design and implementation of `mdspan`, a proposed C++ standard multidimensional array view (planned for inclusion in C++23).<br>The proposal is largely inspired by work done in the Kokkos project\u2014a C++ performance-portable programming model deployed by numerous HPC institutions to prepare their code base for exascale-class supercomputing systems. This paper describes the final design of mdspan after a five-year process to achieve consensus in the C++ community.  In particular, we will lay out how the design addresses some of the core challenges of performance-portable programming, and how its customization points allow a seamless extension into areas not currently addressed by the C++ Standard but which are of critical importance in the heterogeneous computing world of today's systems.  Finally, we have provided a production-quality implementation of the proposal in its current form. This work includes several benchmarks of this implementation aimed at demonstrating the zero-overhead nature of the modern design."

As is well known, C++ programmers use templates to specialize algorithms, thus allowing the compiler to generate highly-efficient code for specific parameters, data structures, and so on. This capability has been limited to those specializations that can be identified when the application is compiled, and in many critical cases, compiling all potentially-relevant specializations is not practical. ClangJIT provides a well-integrated C++ language extension allowing template-based specialization to occur during program execution. This capability has been implemented for use in large-scale applications, and we demonstrate that just-in-time-compilation-based dynamic specialization can be integrated into applications, often requiring minimal changes (or no changes) to the applications themselves, providing significant performance improvements, programmer-productivity improvements, and decreased compilation time."

It is often unrealistic or undesirable for developers to maintain separate implementations for each target architecture, yet in many cases, achieving high performance and fully utilizing an architecture\u2019s underlying features requires the use of specialized language constructs and libraries. Likewise, abstractions and standards that promise portability cannot necessarily deliver high performance without additional algorithmic considerations, and performance compromises are often made to remain portable. Application developers, who strive to work productively while balancing these concerns, often find the goal to be elusive.<br><br>There is a clear need to develop ways of managing the complexity that arises from system diversity that balance the need for performant specializations with the economy of appropriate and efficient abstractions. Despite growth in the number of available architectures, there are similarities that represent general trends in current and emerging HPC hardware: increased thread parallelism; wider vector units; specialized hardware units; and deep, complex, memory hierarchies. This in turn offers some hope for common programming techniques and language support as community experience matures.<br><br>The purpose of this workshop is to provide an opportunity for attendees to share ideas, practical experiences, and methodologies for tackling the challenge of achieving performance portability and developer productivity across current and future homogeneous and heterogeneous computer architectures.<br><br><a href=\"https://p3hpc2019.lbl.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">https://p3hpc2019.lbl.gov/</a>"

The Sequential Codelet Model heavily borrows from the successful experience acquired through decades of sequential program execution, in particular, the use of Instruction Level Parallelism optimizations for implicit parallel execution of code. We revisit and re-define the Universal Turing Machine and the Von Neumann Architecture to account for the hierarchical organization of the whole computation system and its resources (i.e. memory, computational capabilities, and interconnection networks), as well as consider program complexity and structure in relation to its execution. This work defines the Sequential Codelet Model (SCM), the Hierarchical Turing Machine (HTM), and the Hierarchal Von Neumann Architecture, as well as explains how implicit parallel execution of programs could be achieved by using these definitions."

      "description": "Many scientific workloads are comprised of many tasks, where each task is an independent simulation or analysis of data. The execution of millions of tasks on heterogeneous HPC platforms requires scalable dynamic resource management and multi-level scheduling. RADICAL-Pilot  (RP) -- an implementation of the Pilot abstraction, addresses these challenges and serves as an effective runtime system to execute workloads comprised of many tasks. In this paper, we characterize the performance of executing many tasks using RP when interfaced with JSM and PRRTE on Summit: RP is responsible for resource management and task scheduling on acquired resource; JSM or PRRTE enact the placement of launching of scheduled tasks. Our experiments provide lower bounds on the performance of RP when integrated with JSM and PRRTE. Specifically, for workloads comprised of homogeneous single-core, 15 minutes-long tasks we find that: PRRTE scales better than JSM for > O(1000) tasks; PRRTE overheads are negligible; and PRRTE supports optimizations that lower the impact of overheads and enable resource utilization of 63% when executing O(16K), 1-core tasks over 404 compute nodes."

      "description": "The Message Passing Interface has been the dominating programming model for developing scalable and high-performance parallel applications. Collective operations empower group communication operations in a portable, and efficient manner and are used by a large number of applications across different domains. Optimization of collective operations is the key to achieve good performance speed-ups and portability. Broadcast or One-to-all communication is one of the most commonly used collectives in MPI applications. However, the existing algorithms for broadcast do not effectively utilize the high degree of parallelism and increased message rate capabilities offered by modern architectures. In this paper, we address these challenges and propose a Scalable Multi-Endpoint broadcast algorithm that combines hierarchical communication with multiple endpoints per node for high performance and scalability. We evaluate the proposed algorithm against state-of-the-art designs in other MPI libraries, including MVAPICH2, Intel MPI, and Spectrum MPI. We demonstrate the benefits of the proposed algorithm at benchmark and application level at scale on four different hardware architectures, including Intel Cascade Lake, Intel Skylake, AMD EPYC, and IBM POWER9, and with InfiniBand and Omni-Path interconnects. Compared to other state-of-the-art designs, our proposed design shows up to 2.5 times performance improvements at a microbenchmark level with 128 Nodes. We also observe up to 37% improvement in broadcast communication latency for the SPECMPI scientific applications"

      "description": "Recent advances in processor technologies have led to highly multi-threaded and dense multi- and many-core HPC systems. The adoption of such dense multi-core processors is widespread in the Top500 systems. Message Passing Interface (MPI) has been widely used to scale out scientific applications. The communication designs for intra-node communication in MPI are mainly based on shared memory communication. The increased core-density of modern processors warrants the use of efficient shared memory communication designs to achieve optimal performance. While there have been various algorithms and data-structures proposed for the producer-consumer like scenarios in the literature, there is a need to revisit them in the context of MPI communication on modern architectures to find the optimal solutions that work best for modern architectures. <br>In this paper, we first propose a set of low-level benchmarks to evaluate various data-structures such as Lamport queues, Fast-Forward queues, and Fastboxes (FB) for shared memory communication. Then, we bring these designs into the MVAPICH2 MPI library and measure their impact on the MPI intra-node communication for a wide variety of communication patterns. The benchmarking results are carried out on modern multi-/many-core architectures including Intel Xeon CascadeLake and Intel Knights Landing."

The ACM SIGHPC SYSPROS Virtual Chapter, the sponsor for this workshop, has been established to provide opportunities to develop and grow relationships among HPC systems administration practitioners and to act as a support resource for them. <br><br>This workshop is designed to share best practices for common HPC system deployment and maintenance, to provide a platform to discuss upcoming technologies, and to present state of the practice techniques that increase performance and reliability of systems, and in turn increase researcher and analyst productivity."

Community projects range from systems research developing exascale operating systems, virtualization methods, performance variability studies, and power management research to projects in software defined networking, machine learning, and resource management. What makes Chameleon unique is that it provides these sophisticated capabilities based on a mainstream infrastructure cloud system (OpenStack). In this talk, I will explain the challenges we faced in building Chameleon, lessons learned, operations experiences, and describe our packaging of the system that integrates both the developed capabilities and the operational experience and facilitates managing platforms of this kind."

      "description": "High-Performance Computing (HPC) cluster-management software<br />often consolidates cluster-management functionality into a central-<br />ized management node, using it to provision the compute nodes,<br />manage users, and schedule jobs. A consequence of this design<br />is that the management node must typically be up and operating<br />correctly for the cluster to schedule and continue executing jobs.<br />This dependency de-incentivizes administrators from upgrading<br />the management node because the entire cluster may need to be<br />taken down during the upgrade. Administrators may even avoid<br />performing minor updates to the management node for fear that<br />an update error could bring the cluster down.<br />To address this problem, we redesigned the structure of manage-<br />ment nodes, specifically OpenHPC\u2019s System Management Server<br />(SMS), breaking it into components that allow portions of the SMS<br />to be taken down and upgraded without interrupting the rest of the<br />cluster. Our approach separates the time-critical SMS tasks from<br />tasks that can be delayed, allowing us to keep a relatively small<br />number of time-critical tasks running while bringing down critical<br />portions of the SMS for long periods of time to apply OpenHPC<br />upgrades, update applications, and perform acceptance tests on the<br />new system.<br />We implemented and deployed our solution on the University of<br />Kentucky\u2019s HPC cluster, and it has already helped avoid downtime<br />from an SMS failure. It also allows us to reduce, or completely<br />eliminate our regularly scheduled maintenance windows."

      "description": "Login nodes are shared resources that are meant for small, lightweight tasks such as submitting to the batch system, scripting, compiling, and staging data. Because they are shared resources, the responsiveness of login nodes depends on users being good citizens with respect to CPU time and memory usage. Many HPC centers have policies that define behavior that is acceptable. However, the unfortunate reality is that users frequently violate these policies and negatively impact the work of others. This impact is exacerbated by the fact that administrators often have to police users\u2019 behavior.<br /><br />Arbiter is a service that addresses the misuse of login nodes by automatically enforcing policies using cgroups. When users log in, Arbiter sets a default hard memory and CPU limit on the user to prevent them from dominating the whole machine\u2019s memory and CPU resources. To enforce policies, Arbiter tracks the usage of individual users over a set interval and looks for policy violations. When a violation occurs, the violating user is emailed about what behavior constituted the violation and the acceptable usage policy for login nodes. In addition, Arbiter also temporarily lowers the hard memory and CPU limit to discourage excessive usage. The length of time and severity of the lower hard limit depends on whether a user has repeatedly violated policies to penalize users for continued excessive usage. The result of the Arbiter service is that login nodes stay responsive, with users informed of policies and discouraged from running computationally heavy jobs on login nodes."

Due to this amount of metadata generated, managing it can be a significant challenge. Traditional tools such as ls, find, and du are quickly becoming insufficient for peta-scale storage and beyond. <br /><br />In this talk, we will share information about the Grand Unified File Index (GUFI) tool and how it can help sites manage large numbers of files and their metadata. As this tool is still under development at the time of investigation, we will go over our methods that are used to index the storage systems at NCAR. Then, the on-going effort of how NCAR is making use of this tool to query metadata will be discussed. Finally, we will share initial testing results that show that find and du commands on some directory trees run over 100 times faster using GUFI."

In order to save staff time, effort and in order to improve the potential for rapid and effective response to emerging problems where systems interact, a \"single pane of glass\" approach is considered optimal. HPC systems typically utilise relatively boutique technology however which is commonly not monitored by existing out-of-the-box monitoring solutions. In this presentation we detail the application of CheckMK, a general use monitoring system, to HPC systems using non-commodity hardware and software. We focus on the development and use of \"check\" scripts, which at EPCC have enabled the System Administrators team to simply and reliably monitor all relevant and service-critical aspects of a variety of HPC systems through a single \"pane of glass\" approach."

We had seen multiple talks by other supercomputing facilities who had deployed MFA, but as we planned and deployed our MFA implementation, we found that nobody had talked about the more interesting and difficult challenges, which were largely social rather than technical. Our MFA deployment was a success, but, more importantly, much of what we learned could apply to any infrastructure change. Additionally, we developed the sshproxy service, a key piece of infrastructure technology that lessens user and staff burden and has made our MFA implementation more amenable to scientific workflows. We found great value in using robust open-source components where we could and developing tailored solutions where necessary."

      "description": "Typical HPC job scheduler software determines scheduling order by a linear sum of weighted priority terms. When a system has a rich mix of job types, this makes it difficult to maintain good productivity across diverse user groups. Currently-implemented fair-share algorithms tweak priority calculations based on \\emph{past} job handling by modifying priority, but don't fully solve problems of queue-stuffing and various classes of under-served job types, because of coupling between different terms of the linear calculated priority . <br /> <br />This paper proposes a new scheme of scheduling jobs on an HPC system called ``Simultaneous Fair-share'' (or ``SFS'') that works by considering the jobs already committed to run in a given time slice and adjusting which jobs are selected to run accordingly. This allows high-throughput collaborations to get lots of jobs run, but avoids the problems of some groups starving out others due to job characteristics, all while keeping system administrators from having to directly manage job schedules. This paper presents Simultaneous Fair-share in detail, with examples, and shows testing results using a job throughput and scheduler simulation."

HPC Systems Professionals include system engineers, system administrators, network administrators, storage administrators, and operations staff who face problems that are unique to high performance computing systems. While many separate conferences exist for the HPC field and for the systems administration field, none exist that focus specifically on the needs of HPC systems professionals. As such, it can be difficult to find support resources who are able to help with the issues encountered in this specialized field. The ACM SIGHPC SYSPROS Virtual Chapter, the sponsor for this workshop, has been established to provide opportunities to develop and grow relationships among HPC systems administration practitioners and to act as a support resource for them.<br><br>This workshop is designed to share best practices for common HPC system deployment and maintenance, to provide a platform to discuss upcoming technologies, and to present state of the practice techniques that increase performance and reliability of systems, and in turn increase researcher and analyst productivity.<br><br><a href=\"http://sighpc-syspros.org/workshops/2019/\" target=\"_blank\">http://sighpc-syspros.org/workshops/2019/</a>"

      "description": "This proposal describes a plan to continue the Industry/University Joint International Workshop on Data-Center Automation, Analytics, and Control (DAAC) to be hosted at the 2019 ACM/IEEE Supercomputing Conference (SC19). This workshop proposal is an outcome of intensive discussions from academia, industry, and national laboratory researchers that led to successful previous instances hosted at SC\u201918 and UCC\u201917. Looking at the last year\u2019s attendance at SC\u201918, DAAC has attracted up to ~80 attendees and had 50.6 attendees on average. DAAC\u201918 featured an industry panel, 3 invited talks from both academia and industry, and 10 paper talks from academia, national labs, and industry, selected through a rigorous review process (at least three reviews for each paper). DAAC\u201917 featured three invited speakers from industry and a panel of five experts and different stakeholders in addition to presentations from peer-reviewed papers.<br><br>This proposed new instance of the DAAC workshop at SC remains a unique workshop that promotes collaboration among academia, industry, and national labs and remains jointly organized by academic and industry researchers. The objective is to promote and stimulate community\u2019s interactions to address some of most critical challenges in automation, analytics, and control specifically aimed for the needs of large-scale data centers in high-performance/high-end computing. DAAC\u201919 will provide a valuable addition to main conference programs. Taking advantage of the opportune match to the SC19 audience, DAAC\u201919 expects to attract a larger number of attendees from academia, industry, and government labs who are interested in data center automated management, operation, and maintenance.<br><br>Workshop website: http://daac-workshop.org."

The goals of this tool are: 1) to fulfill a set of visual tasks on cloud computing retrieved from in-depth interviews with domain experts, 2) to visualize and monitor large real-world data in terms of both the number of profiles and number of time steps, and 3) to aid system administrator to trace and understand the causal relationship of multivariate data. To reach these goals, our system composes several interconnected visual components. The customized heatmap is used to capture the pattern of a single machine as well as a group of machines, the progressive rendering of parallel coordinate allows users to see the dynamic behavior of running task/job over time, the scatterplot matrices are used in conjunction with the parallel graph for anomaly extraction. The results on the Alibaba Cloud Trace dataset show that the visualization tools offer great support for users to have a high-level overview of a large dataset as well as understand the causal relations within multivariate data."

      "description": "In this paper we present MetricQ, a novel infrastructure for collecting, archiving, and analyzing sensor data. Core components of MetricQ are a scalable message broker based on the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol, and a newly developed Hierarchical Timeline Aggregation (HTA) storage concept that is specifically designed for timeseries data. HTA requires moderate data processing during data collection and a storage space overhead of about 10 %, and in turn reduces the complexity of typical timeline request from O(N) to O(1). This enables access to very large metric timelines spanning years and billions of data points at a performance level that is sufficient for interactive use cases. In contrast to existing solutions in this domain, no relevant information such as very short peaks in the data is discarded. We demonstrate how we use MetricQ with few metrics at very high update rates, e.g., for energy efficiency research, and for a very large number of metrics at moderate update rates, e.g., monitoring data from the electrical and cooling infrastructure of our data center."

Toward this goal, we analyze various system logs such as error logs, job logs and environment logs from Argonne Leadership Computing Facility's (ALCF) Theta Cray XC40 supercomputer. This log data incorporates multiple subsystem and component measurements at various fidelity levels and temporal resolutions - a very diverse and massive dataset. To effectively identify various patterns that characterize system behavior and faults over time, we have developed a visual analytics tool, MELA,  to better identify patterns and glean insights from these log data."

      "description": "The massive scale of high performance computing machines necessitates the use of automatic statistical methods to assist human operators in monitoring day-to-day behavior. The largest high performance computing machines today produce on the order of terabytes of monitoring information each day.  We specifically address the problem of identifying problematic compute jobs running on these massive machines by modeling the computer-generated text logs known as system logs, which record all activities on the machine in near-natural language form. We apply techniques from relational learning and human language technology, as well as making use of systems domain knowledge, in order to extract features from system logs produced by approximately 10,000 high performance computing jobs.  We then evaluate the usefulness of these features by training a random forest model to predict job outcome (completion, failure, timeout, or node failure) in real time. We compare our models to a baseline which mimics state-of-the-art human operator behavior, and find that the best-performing feature set is one which combines domain knowledge with simple aggregate numerical content and temporal metrics. We find that in the average case, our method can predict job outcomes with an F1 score approaching 0.9 after a job has been running for only 30 minutes, giving an average lead time of 3 hours before failure during which a human operator could take mitigating action. The work is a proof-of-concept which suggests the ability to develop a production tool that would raise early alerts based on job outcome predictions."

      "description": "With the advent of new applications such as Cloud Computing, Big Data, and Machine Learning, modern data center network (DCN) architecture has been evolving to meet numerous challenging requirements such as scalability, agility, energy efficiency and high performance. The above new applications are expediting the convergence of High-Performance Computing and Data Centers. Inspired by hypermeshes, this paper presents HyperOXN, a novel cost-efficient topology for<br>exascale Data Center Networks (DCNs). HyperOXN takes advantage of high-radix switch components leveraging state-of-the-art colorless dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) technologies, effectively supports \u0003-cast traffic and at the same time meets the demands on high throughput and low latency. It\u2019s shown that HyperOXN outperforms a comparable Fat-Tree topology in cost, throughput and power consumption under a variety of workload conditions."

This workshop proposal is an outcome of intensive discussions from academia, industry, and national laboratory researchers that led to successful previous instances hosted at SC\u201918 and UCC\u201917. Looking at the last year\u2019s attendance at SC\u201918, DAAC has attracted up to ~80 attendees and had 50.6 attendees on average. DAAC\u201918 featured an industry panel, 3 invited talks from both academia and industry, and 10 paper talks from academia, national labs, and industry, selected through a rigorous review process (at least three reviews for each paper). DAAC\u201917 featured three invited speakers from industry and a panel of five experts and different stakeholders in addition to presentations from peer-reviewed papers.<br><br>This proposed new instance of the DAAC workshop at SC remains a unique workshop that promotes collaboration among academia, industry, and national labs and remains jointly organized by academic and industry researchers. The objective is to promote and stimulate community\u2019s interactions to address some of most critical challenges in automation, analytics, and control specifically aimed for the needs of large-scale data centers in high-performance/high-end computing. DAAC\u201919 will provide a valuable addition to main conference programs. Taking advantage of the opportune match to the SC19 audience, DAAC\u201919 expects to attract a larger number of attendees from academia, industry, and government labs who are interested in data center automated management, operation, and maintenance.<br><br><a href=\"http://daac-workshop.org\" target=\"_blank\"> http://daac-workshop.org</a>"

      "description": "Addressing failures in extreme-scale systems remains a significant challenge to reaching exascale.  Current projections suggest that at the scale necessary to sustain exaflops of computation, systems could experience failures as frequently as once per hour.  As a result, robust and efficient fault tolerance techniques are critical to obtaining reasonable application performance. Additionally, it is also imperative that we develop an understanding of trends in hardware devices may affect the reliability of future systems.  The emergence of high-bandwidth memory devices, the continued deployment of burst buffers, and the development of near-threshold devices to address power concerns will all impact fault tolerance on new systems.  These design trends coupled with increases in the number, variety, and complexity of components required to compose an extreme-scale system means that systems will experience significant increases in aggregate fault rates, fault diversity, and the complexity of isolating root causes.<br><br>Due to the continued need for research on fault tolerance in extreme-scale systems, the 9th Workshop on Fault-Tolerance for HPC at Extreme Scale (FTXS 2019) will present an opportunity for innovative research ideas to be shared, discussed, and evaluated by researchers in fault-tolerance, resilience, dependability, and reliability from academic, government, and industrial institutions.  Building on the success of the previous editions of the FTXS workshop, the organizers will assemble quality publications, invited talks, and panels to facilitate a lively and thought-provoking group discussion."

      "description": "With the increase in scale and architectural complexity of supercomputers, the management of failures has become integral to successfully executing a long-running high- performance computing application. In many instances, failures have a localized scope, usually impacting a subset of the resources being used, yet widely used failure recovery strategies (like checkpoint/restart) fail to take advantage and rely on global, synchronous recovery actions. Even with local rollback recovery, in which only the fault impacted processes are restarted from a checkpoint, the consistency of further progress in the execution is achieved through the replay of communication from a message log. This theoretically sound approach encounters some practical limitations: the presence of collective operations forces a synchronous recovery that prevents survivor processes from continuing their execution, removing any possibility for overlapping further computation with the recovery; and the amount of resources required at recovering peers can be un- tenable. In this work, we solved both problems by implementing an asynchronous, receiver-driven replay of point-to-point and collective communications, and by exploiting remote-memory access capabilities to access the message logs. This new protocol is evaluated in an implementation of local rollback over the User Level Failure Mitigation fault tolerant Message Passing Interface (MPI). It reduces the recovery times of the failed processes by an average of 59%, while the time spent in the recovery by the survivor processes is reduced by 95% when compared to an equivalent global rollback protocol, thus living to the promise of a truly localized impact of recovery actions."

      "description": "To fully leverage the emerging non-volatile main memory (NVMM) for high-performance computing, programmers need efficient data structures that are aware of NVMM memory models and provide crash consistency. Manual creation of NVMM-aware persistent data structures requires a deep understanding of how and when to create persistent snapshots of memory objects corresponding to the data structures and substantial code modification, which makes it very difficult to use in its manual form even for experienced programmers. To simplify the process, we design a compiler-assistant technique, NVPath. With the aid of compilers, it automatically generates NVMM-aware persistent data structures which provide the same level of guarantee of crash consistency compared to the baseline code. Compiler-assistant code annotation and transformation is general and can be applied to applications using various data structures. Furthermore, it is a gray-box technique which requires minimum users\u2019 input. Finally, it keeps the baseline code structure for good readability and maintenance. Our experimental results with real-world scientific applications (e.g., matrix multiplication, LU decomposition, adaptive-mesh refinement, and page ranking) show that the performance of annotated programs is commensurate with the version using the manual code transformation on the Titan supercomputer."

      "description": "System reliability is expected to be a significant challenge for future extreme-scale systems. Poor reliability results in a higher frequency of interruptions in high-performance computer (HPC) applications due to system/application crashes or data corruption due to soft errors. In response, application level error detection and recovery schemes are devised to mitigate the impact of these interruptions. Evaluating these schemes and the reliability of an application re- quires the analysis of thousands of fault injection trials, resulting in tedious and time-consuming process. Furthermore, there is no one data analysis tool that can work with all of the fault injection frameworks currently in use. In this paper, we present FaultSight, a fault injection analysis tool capable of efficiently assisting in the analysis of HPC application reliability as well as the effectiveness of resiliency schemes. FaultSight is designed to be flexible and work with data coming from a variety of fault injection frameworks. The effectiveness of FaultSight is demonstrated by exploring the reliabil- ity of different versions of the Matrix-Matrix Multiplication kernel using two different fault injection tools. In addition, the detection and recovery schemes are highlighted for the HPCCG mini-app."

      "description": "Hardware faults (i.e., soft errors) are projected to increase in modern HPC systems. The faults often lead to error propagation in programs and result in silent data corruptions (SDCs), seriously compromising system reliability. Selective instruction duplication, a widely used software-based error detector, has been shown to be effective in detecting SDCs with low performance overhead. In the past, researchers have relied on compiler intermediate representation (IR) for program reliability analysis and code transformation in selective instruction duplication. However, they assumed that the IR-based analysis and protection are representative under realistic fault models (i.e., faults originated at lower hardware layers). Unfortunately, the assumptions have not been fully validated, leading to questions about the accuracy and efficiency of the protection since IR is a higher level of abstraction and far away from hardware layers. In this paper, we verify the assumption by injecting realistic hardware faults to programs that are guided and protected by IR-based selective instruction duplication. We find that the protection yields high SDC coverage with low performance overhead even under realistic fault models, albeit a small amount of such faults escaping the detector. Our observations confirm that IR-based selective instruction duplication is a cost-effective method to protect programs from soft errors."

      "description": "As HPC systems grow in scale to meet increased computational demands, the incidence of faults in a given window of time is expected to grow. This issue is addressed by the scientific community with research on solutions in every computational layer.<br><br>In this paper, we explore strategies for fault tolerance at the algorithmic level. We propose a node-failure-tolerant preconditioned conjugate gradient method, which is able to efficiently recover from node failures without the use of extra spare nodes, i. e., without any overhead in terms of available hardware. For purposes of load balancing, we redistribute the surviving and reconstructed solver data. The objective is to reconstruct the system either as it was before the node failure, or an equivalent, permuted version, and then continue the execution of the solver only on the surviving nodes.<br><br>In our experimental evaluations, the recovery stage of the solver typically takes around 10% or less of the solver runtime, including the time to retrieve the problem-defining static data from the hard disk, and, when using a suitable preconditioner, an average solver runtime overhead of 3.5% over that of a resilient solver that uses a replacement node. We investigate the influence of the preconditioner on a trade-off between load-balancing and communication cost in the recovery phase. The obtained solutions are correct, and our method is thus a feasible way to recover from a node failure and continue the execution of the solver only on the surviving nodes."

      "description": "Addressing failures in extreme-scale systems remains a significant challenge to reaching exascale. Current projections suggest that at the scale necessary to sustain exaflops of computation, systems could experience failures as frequently as once per hour. As a result, robust and efficient fault tolerance techniques are critical to obtaining reasonable application performance. Additionally, it is also imperative that we develop an understanding of trends in hardware devices may affect the reliability of future systems. The emergence of high-bandwidth memory devices, the continued deployment of burst buffers, and the development of near-threshold devices to address power concerns will all impact fault tolerance on new systems. These design trends coupled with increases in the number, variety, and complexity of components required to compose an extreme-scale system means that systems will experience significant increases in aggregate fault rates, fault diversity, and the complexity of isolating root causes.<br><br>Due to the continued need for research on fault tolerance in extreme-scale systems, the 9th Workshop on Fault-Tolerance for HPC at Extreme Scale (FTXS 2019) will present an opportunity for innovative research ideas to be shared, discussed, and evaluated by researchers in fault-tolerance, resilience, dependability, and reliability from academic, government, and industrial institutions. Building on the success of the previous editions of the FTXS workshop, the organizers will assemble quality publications, invited talks, and panels to facilitate a lively and thought-provoking group discussion.<br><br><a href=\"https://sites.google.com/site/ftxsworkshop/home/ftxs-2019\" target=\"_blank\"> https://sites.google.com/site/ftxsworkshop/home/ftxs-2019</a>"

Massive digital data, powerful networks and inexpensive accelerators are bringing new data-driven approaches to technical computing. Extensive instrumentation, monitoring and control of high performance computing systems and their data-centers is the big data behind big data. The emergence of big data as a reality is challenging long held beliefs about technical computing approaches and illuminating old questions in new ways. How do we best meet soft real-time constraints for streaming data, subject to energy, communication, operation and cost constraints?  For example, can we use AI for performance and efficiency tuning of both HPC applications and the data-center? How does HPC respond to the rapidly shifting hardware and software vendor ecosystem emphasis on AI hardware and software?  This panel will discuss how we got here and where we are likely to go."
