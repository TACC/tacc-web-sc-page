			"title": "A High-Productivity Tool for Interactive Parallelization",
			"description": "IPT is a high-productivity tool that can semi-automatically parallelize certain types of serial C/C++ programs and is currently being used for teaching parallel programming to students and domain-experts. It solicits the specifications for parallelization from the users, such as, what to parallelize and where. On the basis of these specifications, IPT translates the serial programs into working parallel versions using one of the three popular parallel programming paradigms, which are: MPI, OpenMP, and CUDA. Hence, IPT can free the users from the burden of learning the syntax of the different parallel programming paradigms, and any manual reengineering required for parallelizing the existing serial programs. The performance of the parallel versions generated using IPT is within 10% of the performance of the best hand-written parallel versions available to us."

			"description": "Frontera, the new NSF leadership-class resource at TACC, provides unprecedented investigative power to open-science researchers. Much of the data generated on Frontera will be too large to analyze using conventional post-hoc methods. In this talk, Paul Navrátil will discuss the capabilities and tools that TACC is developing and deploying on Frontera to enable remote and in situ analysis, including the Galaxy distributed ray tracing framework."

More than 15 active projects across a wide range of domains of science and engineering rely on Tapis to accomplish their research objectives. In this talk, we will introduce Tapis, cover its primary capabilities, and highlight some of the interesting ways projects are using it today."

			"title": "Improving a Science Gateways’ Efficiency and Effectiveness by Implementing User-Centered Design",
			"description": "The Science Gateways Community Institute (SGCI), which TACC is a core member,  provides science gateways and HPC portals with services to coach gateway teams on sustainability best practices and offer a variety of consulting engagements. One of our most heavily used consulting engagements is usability. Lead by Dr. Paul Parsons at Purdue University, Parsons and his team of usability consultants apply user-centered methods to help improve the usability of gateways. Through this presentation, we hope to increase the appreciation of the multiple dimensions of usability, identify violations of design principles, and build strategies for identifying and fixing usability problems. We also would like to share use-cases of gateways we have worked with and run through a live user testing scenario with the crowd to demonstrate how a user study could be conducted by anyone."
